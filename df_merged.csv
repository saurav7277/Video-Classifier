MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

This talk was originally meant to be given at the controversial Pakistan Tourism Summit 2019 in Islamabad, but was cut out by the organizers once they realized its critical nature. Let's see if the internet is more open minded than they were.

I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
 
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

xHUTACt84n0,10 Best Places to Visit in Austria - Travel Video,"Austria is a country that is as well known for its scenic beauty as it is for its cultural activities. Situated in the Alps, it is a very popular place with skiers and hikers, but it is also a country that gave the world an important musical heritage, ranging from the classical composer Mozart to the Strauss waltzes and the Von Trapp family whose story was told in The Sound of Music. An overview of the best places to visit in Austria:",travel
YXz-erPr8B8,Montevideo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Uruguay is emerging as one of South America‚Äôs favorite destinations. Its capital Montevideo has a warm, temperate climate, pleasant sea breezes and miles of boulevards.

From Montevideo‚Äôs Telecommunications Tower you can see the hill that gave the city its name.

Another tower, the Palacio Salvo looms high above the Plaza Independencia in the City Center. Under this square is the mausoleum for the country‚Äôs revolutionary hero Jos√© Artigas.

Nearby Plaza Matriz is the city‚Äôs oldest square and home to the 18th-century Metropolitan Cathedral, the focal point of Uruguay‚Äôs Old Town.

Soccer is big here and in 1930 Uruguay hosted and won the first-ever FIFA World Cup in the Estadio Centenario.

Another proud local tradition is ‚Äúparrilla"" and the best way to try it is to buy cuts of meat in the Mercado del Puerto, and have those cooked for you on the spot.

The 19-mile long promenade, La Rambla leads to the city‚Äôs favorite playground: De Los Pocitos Beach.

To the west along the river is the UNESCO-listed Old Town of Colonia del Sacramento, with its landmark lighthouse, sleepy Plaza de Armas, historic Port√≥n de Campo and atmospheric Street of Sighs.

To the east of Montevideo, if you follow the coast, is Piri√°polis. This beach resort offers great views from its hilltop San Antonio Temple. 

The next highlight on this road trip is the lighthouse of La Paloma on the Cabo de Santa Mar√≠a peninsula.
On your way to the lighthouse of Punta del Este, don‚Äôt miss eccentric Casapueblo, a wonderful hotel and art gallery designed by local artist Carlos P√°ez Vilar√≥ in Punta Ballena.

Uruguay may be small, but its big heart and relaxing vibe create a lifetime of memories.

zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

I never got confronted with this kind of violence - I was brought to the hospital and spend around 5 hours there.
It was at some point maybe also my fault as said in the video - but bad things can happen everywhere in the world. 

I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!
I thank all of you guys for your kind words and support afterwards - with your help I'm now almost recovered and continue what I love to do: Traveling.

How do bloggers make money?

I love, absolutely love reading about success stores of people starting a website, putting in the hard work for years and building wealth for themselves while producing a lot of value for everyone else.

This video is based of this Reddit post: 
The website in question is: 

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

Uso la Canon600D

Come editi i tuoi video?
Con Final Cut PRO X (solo per MAC)

Come realizzi le miniature dei video?
Con Picmonkey (programma gratuito online) 

Come fai a collaborare con le aziende?
Avendo un canale youtube dove tratto argomenti femminili dal makeup, ai capelli, ai vestiti, ai prodotti per il corpo solitamente vengo contattata dalle aziende che mi propongono i loro prodotti. Se ritengo che il prodotto sia valido e interessante accetto di collaborare, non mostro mai nei miei video dei prodotti che non uso davvero o con cui non mi sono trovata bene :)",travel

UmF5il2bl8g,üé• Sri Lankan street food - Kottu Roti - Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food,"üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Kottu & Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. On our last night before moving on we stopped at a Kottu Hoppers place, you can hear in the video of this the incredible noise that is made when making Kottu as the two large scrappers hit the hotplate and chop the roti with vegetables and spices. Well that was our time in this villa, amazing. So in the morning we take a 3 hour drive east to Kandy, see you when we arrive. Kottu is Roti or a type of flat bread chopped with a sauce of some kind added in the mix. The sound of kottu being made really is the background music of Sri Lanka. Cooks chop out on a hot flat griddle the roti and then add in pretty much whatever you can think of. Chicken curry, Vegetable curry and so on are popular. As the cooks hit the griddle with what looks like big scrappers, the sound of metal on metal fills the air. We pulled up outside a Kottu house and ordered from the car. Chicken and Cheese was our choice and it was brought over as we sat in the minivan. Plenty of fresh chilli and crispy chicken soon left my plate and i am now ready to go back to the hotel, feeling totally satisfied with my day. See you in the morning. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Savory hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.Short eats are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.
Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 
Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors.",travel

JHWlSrIgwwE,Lanzarote Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The island oasis of Lanzarote, Spain, is eagerly awaiting your arrival. Venture to the easternmost island of the Spanish archipelago and discover this scenic hot spot. With the help of artist and architect Cesar Manrique, Lanzarote‚Äôs landscape has integrated the natural beauty of the island with organic building designs. 

Kick-start your travels at the Cesar Manrique Foundation, which was once the home of the famous architect. You‚Äôll come across rooms that are built into caves created by a volcano eruption long ago. To see more of Manrique‚Äôs artistic work, head to the Jardin de Cactus, which features more than 10,000 plants, and then relish the majestic views from the Mirador del Rio. Jameos del Agua is another fascinating attraction, where you can climb down the staircase into caves with restaurants and a concert venue. 

Want to see more of the island‚Äôs captivating scenery? Tour the fire mountains at Timanfaya National Park and marvel at the flames rising from the center of the earth, or simply bask on the pristine shores of Playa del Carmen. If you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, head to the rock pools at Punta Mujeres and go on a snorkeling excursion around the cove. To top it all off, round out your adventures with a jaunt to the charming village of Yaiza, a 17th-century town, and soak up the touristy area at Puerto del Carmen. 

Come to this slice of paradise for the beaches and Manrique‚Äôs contributions. Whatever you decide to do during your stay, take a peek at our Lanzarote travel guide for the inside scoop on this inviting destination.

S-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900...

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

xraAUbqcE,24 Hours in MADRID. Madrid Travel Blog,"We spend just 24 hours exploring the beautiful city of Madrid, Spain! We start off in one 
of the main squares of the city and eventually make our way to the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Sabatini Gardens. Later we take a run through Parque Del Oeste and find the Temple de Debod. 

As the capital city, a cosmopolitan city, a business center, seat of government, Spanish Parliament, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political centre of Spain. Madrid is characterized by intense cultural and artistic activity and a very lively nightlife.

Madrid, Spain

According to legend the original name of the city was ""Ursaria"" (""land of bears"" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the arbutus (""madro√±o"" in Spanish), have been the emblem (The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city from the Middle Ages

Paseo del Arte

In English, the Art walk, is a place for beauty and art like no other in Europe. In only 1 kilometre, you will come across one of the most important museums in the world; Prado Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Reina Sofia Museum.  Beside this, you will find gardens, historic streets, science centres and libraries. If you don‚Äôt have enough time, try to go there! You will experience the best Madrid can offer. 

TOP 5 in Madrid:

Puerta del Sol

Puerta del Sol is one of Madrid‚Äôs most visited squares. The square is surrounded by many small and historical streets such as Calle Arena and others. Puerta del Sol is a great place to start a walk around the most traditional places in Madrid. 

Cibeles Fountain

Built in 1782, it has become a symbol of the capital. The fountain is built around the Roman goddess Cybele; symbol of the earth, agriculture and fertility. The goddess is depicted being carried by golden lions. Definitely a great palace to visit. 

Plaza Mayor

This square is part of the old part of the city. Plaza Mayor demonstrate the old architecture in Madrid; narrow streets, alleys and passageways, which were once used by swashbuckling swordsmen and medieval rogues.  Plaza Mayor is also well known to be the place for the best open restaurants and bars around this beautiful part of Madrid. 

Royal Palace

The largest palace in Europe, this place was home to the majority of the kings of Spain; from Charles III to Alfonso XIII. Nowadays, although the royal family does not longer live there, it is still used during important visits. The best thing about the royals palace; you can visit it yourself. A great way to admire the best of European architecture.

M6nMXsBErnE,Flight TUS35 Travel Ukulele Review! Mini travel blog and Bieber for Sheriff?,"Don't be fooled by the size of this instrument.  The Flight TUS35 is tiny yet MIGHTY!  With smart design choices such as a strong neck, back and sides made of ABS, the 0 nut, compensated saddle, solid geared tuners, and a rounded back makes this travel ukulele a serious instrument with a great tone.  

Come join me as I test out the Flight TUS35 on a hot day on the boat to see if it withstood the hot temperatures and the great outdoors.  Thank you to my Instagram followers that gave me some amazing questions to answer about the Flight TUS35.  I play several ukuleles side by side so that you can compare the tone to other ukuleles made of different tone woods.  CORRECTION!  The graphic for the Grace VanderWaal Signature ukulele was cut off.  It has a glossy finish to look like walnut, but it is laminate sapele.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog takes us through the breakfast market in Warsaw, Poland to give us a taste of what markets are like in Europe. 

In Warsaw, tons of vendors sell all sorts of different dishes at the breakfast market. Walk around the stalls and you will find fresh produce, homemade products like cheese, and plenty of treats. One of the desserts you can find is the traditional Polish dessert called racuchy. It‚Äôs similar to an apple pancake. The dish is made by rolling apple slices in flour, dipping them in a thick batter, and frying them in oil to make them nice and crispy. It‚Äôs absolutely delicious! Stop by the Vegushka stall for the best racuchy.

‚ñ∫ WHO AM I?

I am a Brazilian journalist living in the United States. After traveling the world working with sports, news, and events for over 15 years, I realized that what I really love is the travel part of it all. So I exchanged the life in the newsrooms and stadiums for the daily challenge of being an independent content producer. 

I created this channel to share the beauties of the world... stuff that for so long I only kept to myself. Also to help people planning similar trips and to inspire more people to venture out and enjoy life!

P.S.: The guy who occasionally appears in the vlogs is my husband, Gordon. He is Canadian-American and is extremely shy, that's why he's behind the camera most of the time ;-)

She enjoyed a budget afternoon tea at Bea's of Bloomsbury. The cultural tradition began in the 1800s and it was a way for the upper class to stave off hunger pains between breakfast and dinner. Every afternoon tea is unique, but they all follow a general template. It includes three tiers of goodness. The first is full of savory sandwiches. The top two tiers have sweets like cupcakes, scones, lemon squares and raspberry marshmallows.

6BoYfs2I0r8,How I make money while traveling the world (and eating),"‚ñ∫How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...
‚ñ∫How to Make Money While Traveling: https://migrationology.com/how-to-mak...

The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!

There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.

First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. 

If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend:  [affiliate])

1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.
2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.
3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.
4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.

Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.

Kk1YSv2fFg,üé• Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog Colombo - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food Sri Lanka,"‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE to lots of new videos every week: http://bit.ly/htcgYTsub

üé• Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food - Local market in a small village just outside Negombo. Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",travel
Nry1SO45RT4,Top 10 Things to Do in Ecuador (Ecuador Travel Guide),"This list of top 10 things to do in Ecuador shows you the highlights of the country along the avenue of the volcanoes in the Andean region

Ecuador is one of the most diverse countries in the world though it's comparably tiny. Beside the Galapagos Islands (which is the #1 tourist destination in Ecuador) the country has a lot more to offer, therefore I focussed on ""La Sierra"" in this video which is a paradise for landscape lovers and outdoor adventurers.

Another reason to visit the Andean region is that you have the chance to dive into the local culture and get a real feeling of Ecuador. The places to see in Ecuador I focussed on in this short video are the result of my own travels along the center from north to south and are easily doable in 2 weeks time.

Things to do in Ecuador covered in this video:
01)  - Otavalo market in Otavalo
02)  - Hike the Cuicocha lake
03)  - Middle of the World, Mitad del Mundo & Quitsato in Cayambe
04)  - Quito, capital & UNESCO World Heritage
05)  - Termas de Papallacta (hot springs)
06)  - Cayambe Coca National Park
07)  - Quilotoa & Shalala viewpoint
08)  - Tren Crucero & Nariz del Diablo (Devil's nose)
09)  - Inka ruins in Ingapirca
10)  - Cuenca & it's beautiful old town

What are your best things to do in Ecuador?

06T2kabkL7E,Top Places in France: Alsace | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog,"Alsace is a famous region in north eastern France that‚Äôs been producing wine for centuries. Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog shows us why it‚Äôs one of the best areas in France for wine tasting and village hopping. 

The region stretches across 40,000 acres and more than 100 villages. Riquewihr is a town in central Alsace that dates back to medieval times. Being there makes you feel like you‚Äôve traveled back in time! Walk down the cobblestone streets and you‚Äôll see timber-framed, brightly-painted buildings. The architecture has been carefully preserved throughout the centuries, so it appears almost identical to how it looked in the 1500s. The town is packed with restaurants, shops, and wine tasting rooms. Here you‚Äôll find local favorites such as tarte flamb√©e, French crepes, and fragrant cheeses. 

But one of the main reasons why people visit Alsace is to wine taste. The region is known for its Riesling wines, which are actually drier than other Rieslings produced around the world. Go to any village on the Alsace wine route and you‚Äôll be able to taste a variety of wines from family owned vineyards. If you love food, wine, and charming villages, then Alsace is the perfect place for you. Cheers to your next vacation in France!

FAQ:

- Can I use this music in my videos?

To use this music in your videos or media projects, you must first purchase a license from the link above. You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.

- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*

'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.

Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)

- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?

No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. 

- Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?

Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",travel

9FhhHe2eay8,Singapore | Marina Mandarin Executive Club | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,"When it comes to Marina Mandarin Singapore by Meritus, you definitely can't judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the building is unassuming, leaving us insanely unprepared for the jaw-dropping awe you'll experience stepping through into the beating heart of this lovely property.  If you're lucky enough to arrive during the day, you'll be greeted by songbirds whose tunes echo throughout the hotel because all 21 floors open onto an immense atrium.  The staff are friendly and charmingly dressed, the rooms are large, and if you couldn't imagine staying in Singapore and not having the best view ... well, you're in luck because Club Rooms like mine come with a balcony and that iconic view of Marina Bay.

Why You'll Love Marina Mandarin Singapore:
-- Dim Sum Lunch at Peach Blossoms - the restaurant serves up some of the most diverse and inventive dim sum dishes that I've seen in Singapore.  There's a set all-inclusive menu and an √† la carte menu with some really interesting extras like lobster and foie.  OHHH and my favourite part is that they serve bottles of Champagne and have a fab list of sakes and wines, which is not common at most dim sum lunch hotspots. 
-- The Views!  Come on, we all want that stunning skyline view of Singapore and Mandarin Orchard has the best view of Marina Bay Sands and the areas around it, including the ferris wheel.  Just wait 'til you see it at night.
-- Meritus Club Lounge - I've been a huge fan of Meritus Club since I first stayed at Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort on Langkawi last year but Marina Mandarin really stands out.  They basically won my heart by serving Mo√´t & Chandon champagne and some of the most interesting cheeses during the Club's happy hour!

nPOO1Coe2DI,Dubai Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Dubai-Emirate....

Come to Dubai, the ancient City of Gold, for your next vacation.

Modernity and antiquity collide in this vibrant city. Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania¬Æ, a ‚Äúcity‚Äù where children can roleplay various careers.

To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you‚Äôd like to try something a little different and don‚Äôt mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren‚Äôt staying there.

You can‚Äôt finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all. 

Visit our Dubai travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

4tLESFBpxkk,How to Ride the London Tube | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog,"Kate Thomas from the Expedia Viewfinder travel blog shares the basics for getting around London on The Tube. 

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 

3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:

1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 

2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs ¬£5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the ¬£5 and any remaining balance. 

3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.
Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.

The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.

As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess‚Äô anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",travel

Subscribe to our channel: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c...
It has an exact antipodal city: Auckland, New Zealand.

This small town is located 157 kilometres (98 miles) northeast of C√°diz. It has a distinctive setting along a narrow river gorge. The town extends along the course of the Rio Trejo with some houses being built into the rock walls of the gorge itself, created by enlarging natural caves or overhangs and adding an external wall.

Setenil has a reputation for its meat products, particularly chorizo sausage and cerdo (pork) from pigs bred in the surrounding hills. As well as meat, it has a reputation for producing fine pasteles (pastries), and its bars and restaurants are among the best in the region. Its outlying farms also provide Ronda and other local towns with much of their fruit and vegetables.

Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day. 

To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.

You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.  

Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day. 

Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi. 

Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river. 

A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.

WMhkRzeGIMI,How to Be a Travel Blogger ‚Äî Creating Great Content,"This is the intro video for the course Being a Travel Blogger (Even When You're Not Traveling!). If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9

You don‚Äôt have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.

There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: )

Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you‚Äôre not traveling? It‚Äôs a unique form of writer‚Äôs block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it‚Äôs been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What‚Äôs a travel blogger to do?

Well, I‚Äôm here to help you kick that writer‚Äôs block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",travel

Also if you‚Äôre looking to travel to the Netherlands I‚Äôd 100% recommend it, especially Haarlem (a few minutes away from Heemstede and a quick train ride away from Amsterdam), the people are fantastic and Dutch hospitality is truly unparalleled. Also sorry about the wind in a few of these clips, my next investment is a microphone - any recs? Leave them in the comments below.

HMBQmTf-tsI,#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!),"#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)

It feels like everyone now a days is interested in being in a travel blogger. Around the New Year, people get so excited and set all these goals for themselves. They think of a clever blog name, buy their domain, set up their wordpress and all that jazz,. After a few month, the excitement starts to fizzle, you're not as enthusiastic anymore. You're not seeing traffic to your site, or engagement, and then start wondering if you made a big mistake. You may start writing less and less, and just give up on it all together.

Let me ask you this. If you opened a restaurant or a brick and mortar shop, do you think you'd become profitable after a couple of months? You would have to have money saved up to pay ""rent"" because after all, it takes spending money to make money right? 

In this video, I‚Äôll talk about my #1 reason why most travel blogs fail (and no, it's not the lack of travel.)

4yduVcYr0,üé• Sri Lankan Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Trincomalee Vlog Street Food - Trinco,"üé• Trincomalee Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food - Fish Markets Trinco - Trincomalee (Tamil: ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ£‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Øà Tiruk≈ç·πáamalai, Sinhalese: ‡∂≠‡∑ä‚Äç‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂´‡∑è‡∂∏‡∑Ö‡∂∫ Triku·πáƒÅmalaya) also known as Gokanna, is the administrative headquarters of the Trincomalee District and major resort port city of Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, 113 miles south of Jaffna and 69 miles north of Batticaloa, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil language speaking culture on the island for over two millennia. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. People from Trincomalee are known as Trincomalians and the local authority is Trincomalee Urban Council. Trincomalee city is home to the famous Koneswaram temple alluded to in its historic Tamil name Thirukonamalai and is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur. The recorded history of Trincomalee spans more than two and a half thousand years, beginning with civilian settlement associated with the Koneswaram temple in the pre-modern era. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it has served as a major maritime seaport in the international trading history of the island with South East Asia. In the ancient world, it was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni country, developing under the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pallava Dynasty, Chola Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, the Vannimai chieftaincies and the Jaffna kingdom through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue. Trincomalee's urbanization continued when made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city's architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",travel

Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - ",travel

qxk_dNP1Bc8,Vietnam Diaries # 8 Mystic Marble mountains Travel Blog,"Marble Mountains of Danang.
Welcome to this episode of Vietnam diaries. We would take you to fascinating tour of Marble mountains.
It stands as a bridge leading Vietnamese life from the present to the past. Marble mountains is so famous that it is visited by a lot of tourists.
Whoever has visited the cluster would agree that, regardless of it being jam-packed with tourists, it greatly expresses part of  Vietnamese history and culture.
The Marble Mountains are 8 kilometers South of Da Nang city.
Blessed by nature, the Marble Mountains are wonderful to visit at any time of the year. The most beautiful season to experience these tropical coastal mountains is summer, however it is advisable to wear relaxed clothes as there are numerous stairs and a mountain trek to negotiate.
The Marble Mountains are a cluster of five marble and limestone hills located in Da Nang. 
The Marble Mountains were not named by the Vietnamese, but by the French after studying the chemical element of the mountain‚Äôs soil. Accordingly, there are five separate mountains in the cluster, named after the five basic elements of life (according to Eastern philosophy): Kim Son (Mt. Metal), Moc Son (Mt. Plant), Thuy Son (Mt. Water), Hoa Son (Mt. Fire), and Tho Son (Mt. Soil).
Named by King Minh Mang, the five mountains were once a favorite destination for noble classes. A Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism emphasised the value of meditation and institution to set up sanctuaries in these mountains. Today, stepping on each rustic stone stair, listening to your heart beat, you could still feel the hundred-year-old statues whispering stories of the old days.
Before being conquered by the Tran Dynasty in 1471, this mountain was a good shelter for the Cham. Today, in one part of Mt. Soil, you can still find traces of the Cham Temples.

JOts_nmri8k,"Travel Blog Sayulita Mexico - Exploring Hotels, Yoga and More Hidden Beaches","Daily Travel Vlog #79 - It's a new day backpacking through Sayulita Mexico. We start by doing some urban exploring around and found the most amazing hotel called Villa Sayuilta. It's a perfect place to chill out, do some yoga, maybe attend a yoga or wellness retreat. The rooms are very afforadable and just plain awesome!! We then jumped on a mission to find the most amazing beaches hahah which involved alot of walking but when your exploring in other countries that is what it is all about!! We found our exotic paradise beach and then finished the day with some amazing Yoga in Hotelito Los Suenos. Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for a new day and new adventure!!!

How to Vlog? This is the question I asked myself as I started out the new year. I am always looking to be more creative and I decided that this year will be the year that I start a daily vlog. So sitback and step into my daily life. 

Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring. 

A little bit about myself: 
I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.

My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon. We traveled to last year all around Mexico, China, Bali, Hawaii and throughout California and Neveda. I am hoping that 2016 will bring more excitement and more travels, so be sure to subscribe :)

xq2UYBD00,Langkawi | SkyBridge & Glass Bottom CableCar | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Glass bottomed cable cars, panoramic views, and a terrifying glass window you can stand on hundreds of feet above ground ... well, those are just three reasons that the Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCar experience is definitely the biggest and best 'must do and see' activity on Langkawi.  Opened in February 2005, the main boarding station for the gondola-style cable cars is located at the foothills of the picturesque Machincang mountain, said to be on a part of Southeast Asia that is the most ancient and the first to have emerged from the sea.

The SkyBridge is the longest 'free span' and curved bridge in the world and it's exciting just to be standing on it!  I had a challenging but fabulous time as you'll see from the video :-)

3 Tips for the Best Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCab Experience:

1 - Ride in the glass bottomed cable car!  Although the VIP gondolas are pretty cool with music, food & drinks, and only 3 comfy seats per car, I prefer the 95 Ringgit glass bottom SkyCabs for their roomy feel and amazing views.  Don't even consider the normal SkyCab, trust me on this one.
2 - Opt for the SkyGlide!  To go from the top station to the SkyBridge in just a few seconds, riding on the SkyGlide is a breeze and only an extra 10 Ringgits.  Otherwise you have 12 minutes of stairs up and back.
3 - Take off your shoes!  As you walk along Langkawi's SkyBridge you'll notice that a few of the floor panels are made of glass, giving you a birds-eye view of the canyon below.  For some reason, the feeling of standing on that was one of the scariest things I've done in AGES!  It's truly spine chilling but absolutely worth it.  It's one of my favourite memories of the SkyBridge for some reason.

KcMxxDFX1HI,Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"I knew I was in trouble when I was told that afternoon tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur featured 39 unique blends of teas ‚Äì one of them only available at The Ritz in KL! Honestly, how does one decide which tea to sip when the selection is so beautifully mixed? Well, why sip just one when I could be naughty and try four? So I did. That, and indulge in an awe-inspiring selection of savoury and sweet treats that turned this High Tea into the highlight of my week!

Why You‚Äôll Love Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The food is to-die-for delicious. I don‚Äôt have a single complaint or even note from my visit, it was all perfect
- A quartet in white tuxedo jackets plays the prettiest music you can imagine ‚Äì from iconic 50s love songs to popular songs playing on the radio today. Think Breakfast At Tiffany‚Äôs meets Taylor Swift. They made the ambiance perfectly magical
- Their exclusive tea blend is named ‚ÄòThe Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Blend‚Äô and it is a mix of Chinese Tie Kuan Ying (tea served to royalty since the Tang dynasty) and green Oolong that is smooth and creamy, and smells of white flowers to me. I loved it!
- They serve fruit infusions for those looking to avoid the caffeine kick
- TIP for Vegetarians (or anyone with special dietary needs): You will LOVE their VIP service! Call 2 days prior to your visit and the chef will create a personalised afternoon tea menu just for you

TfwxEiOrjug,"Eating Korean Street Food in Seoul, Korea at Tongin Market (ÌÜµÏù∏ÏãúÏû•)","Join us for another exciting episode from Seoul, Korea where we take you to Tongjin Market (ÌÜµÏù∏ÏãúÏû•) to try eating Korean street food for the first time on our trip. From the moment I arrived in Seoul I've been craving Korean street food, especially items such as tteokbokki, kimchi jeon and hotteok, so when we had a short window of opportunity in our schedule we jumped at the chance to eat as much as possible.

David's channel: 

In terms of our Korean street food tour in Seoul we had the following items:

1) Korean kimchi pancake (kimchi-jeon - ÍπÄÏπòÏ†Ñ)
2) 

Have you had street in Seoul before? What is your favorite Seoul street food? Let us know in the comments below.

Eating Korean Street Food in Seoul, Korea at Tongin Market (ÌÜµÏù∏ÏãúÏû•):

Hey guys! We are Samuel and Audrey, a vlogging travel couple from Canada. In this travel channel we share our travel and food vlogs while touring the world.

Our most recent trip was to South Korea where I embarked upon a two-week adventure without Audrey. Invited as part of a YouTube vlogging trip, organized by KTO, I spent the first week traveling with other YouTubers in Seoul, Busan and Gyeongju. My second week included independent exploration of Korea with my good friend and fellow YouTuber David of DavidsBeenHere. 

Having lived and traveled in South Korea, the chance to return to one of my favorite countries was one of the biggest surprises of 2019. On this particular trip, I had an opportunity to do many things I had not previously covered including a visit to the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone between South Korea and North Korea), a Buddhist Temple Stay and a Korean cooking class. It was almost as if the program designed by KTO knew exactly what I had missed out on before.

Obviously, a huge highlight from the two weeks I spent revisiting Korea was the food. I feasted on all of my favorite Korean dishes including Korean barbecue, dolsot bibimbap, haemul pajeon, tteokbokki, bulgogi, kimbap and many others. I can honestly say that Korean food is world-class and is one of my top 5 favorite cuisines in the world. Aside from trying familiar dishes, I had the opportunity to sample raw Korean seafood for the first time.

While visiting Seoul, highlights included going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, Jogyesa Temple and Hongdae. As one of the biggest cities in the world, I barely scratched the surface of things to do in Seoul.

Spending extended time in Busan was my favorite part about the trip with top highlights including a Korean temple stay, fresh fish markets and a Korean baseball game. It was from Busan that we ended up taking a day-trip to Daegu where we enjoyed a traditional Korean market and tried Galbi-Jjim for the first time.

If you want to see more videos from Korea in the future, let us know in the comments what places you'd like us to travel to and what food experiences you'd like to see on this travel channel. 

Have you traveled to South Korea before? What was your experience like? Please share your Korea travel tips, advice and experiences in the comments below. 

Thanks again for watching our Korea travel and food series! Until next time!

If you're looking for the best things to do in Sarajevo city center, I think this video shows some of it!

And the last thing I want to say is... because everyone asks me:  there is no problem being black in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I have experienced ZERO racism in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Balkans is the most friendly place I have ever traveled to and a traveler being black in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not an issue AT ALL.

UiPC63u5-gk,Train trip from Jakarta to Yogyakarta. Indonesia travel blog,"After short visit to Jakarta (capital city of Indonesia) it was time to continue our journey towards Bali island. Next stop - Yogyakarta. Our main reason to travel there was the famous Borobudur Temple - the biggest Buddhist temple in the world, but we'll show it to you in our next travel video. This one is about our train trip from Jakarta to Yogyakarta. As you already know, our budget is more than limited, so we decided to buy the cheapest tickets. We were surprised that traveling vy train in Indonesia (Java Island) is much more expensive than traveling by train in Thailand.  At least it was nice, quite comfortable and had electrical sockets. :)

Azw7vz60zr,The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Staycation Spa Weekend | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"Whether you‚Äôre looking for a spa and foodie weekend ‚Äòstaycation‚Äô or a fabulous hotel to call home during your holiday or business trip to KL, The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur is going to be just what the doctor ordered. Located just 2 kilometres away from the iconic Petronas Towers, The Ritz is a haven of pampering for both the body and soul. Their newly renovated rooms opened only a few months ago but I swear I felt like the first guest to stay in mine (it was utterly pristine) ‚Ä¶ and with attentive butler service, I rarely wanted to leave it. Foodies will love The Ritz because you‚Äôll find something to tempt you day or night between their five diverse restaurants and lounges, with hands-down the best jellyfish in their fine dining Cantonese restaurant Li Yen that I‚Äôve tried in my life.

Why You‚Äôll Love The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:
- The service! I‚Äôve been reviewing 5-star hotels since 2011 and this is the first time I‚Äôve listed ‚Äòservice‚Äô as the #1 love but it‚Äôs true. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I go in the hotel, because I‚Äôve been here a couple of times before (for afternoon tea and once for Sunday brunch) the staff not only knows what I like and brings it without asking but they all magically seem to greet me by name ‚Äì I love that!
- The 1-bedroom suites are bright and modern and so absolutely perfect you'll want to stay IN on this visit to KL.
- The food!  Lordy, lordy the fooooood!  I ate so much, and so well, that I left with a couple extra kilos I'm sure.  Don't miss their afternoon tea (my #1 favourite of the big hotels so far in Kuala Lumpur) or the Menu Du Jour for dinner in The Library, it was my favourite meal of the weekend.
- Champagne 'Sunday Roast' Brunch!  It's a grown up brunch, without donuts or waffle stations, and it's scrumptious.

This episode I visit Marlborough in Wiltshire, a market town with the second widest high street in the UK.  Marlborough is a town full of history, and worthy of a tour.  It's on the A4 Bristol to London, and was a main thoroughfare for trade and travellers. It played a part in the English Civil War and was besieged by Royalist forces who subdued the Parliamentarian enemy.  Nearby are Silbury Hill and Avebury, neolithic structures with their own history.",travel

TvmgIIRprlA,Chicago for Kids and Families with Travel Blog Saucepan Kids,"Chicago for kids and families with travel blog Saucepan Kids. Debbie Woodward, Saucepan Kids Travel Blogger and United Airlines have teamed up to bring you this excellent family travel video. Showing you the best Chicago family activities, Chicago family restaurants and attractions. Enjoy Chicago with kids starting with your business class united airlines flight.



- - Okay, kids in Chicago, we'll you've gotta make sure that you're in the center so that you can walk to all the great family-friendly attractions that are in the center of Chicago. I would say two that you really have to check out, if you're here in Chicago with your kids would be Wrigley Field, that baseball game. Never been to one before, it's so exciting the atmosphere is electric, the kids will love it. Also, I would say Navy Pier, that's iconic really and there's so much for kids to do, you'll be there for the day. Business class with United was amazing, it was such a treat, it was so luxurious and there was so much space. I was blown away by the comfort of the bed when it lay flat, I didn't think I'd sleep but I really did, and the Egyptian cotton bedding was gorgeous. The food was incredible and it just kept coming, there was so much of it and really good quality, not what you expect from airplane food, so that's fabulous. Well worth it. Definitely check out Lou Malnati's, which is the really famous Chicago deep dish pizza joint. A couple of locals recommended it, and I can see why. Great experience, great fun for the kids, really family friendly. And I would say, for a slightly quirky restaurant and still kid friendly is The Purple Pig. I really enjoyed that restaurant, there was a great menu available, surprising. The Dana Hotel, super modern, uber-cool and chic hotel right in the center of Chicago. We were able to walk to everything from the Dana Hotel, really comfortable. Great meal in there actually, we had a nice meal in there as well. And the rooms had everything, everything from gorgeous towels to yoga mats, to huge widescreen TV, coffee machine, everything you could need.",travel

LZYCNrM_HS,CHRONICLES IN WONDERLAND I TRAVEL BLOG,"I‚Äôve studied English and Geography in Heidelberg, Germany and though I‚Äôve done that for ten years I finally finished my Masters Degree in teaching. I applied to schools around the world and Brazil was the first to answer. I am currently living in S√£o Paulo to teach English in a private High School. In my free time I travel as much as I can. Though I love my job, I figured that it was time for something new for a bit and decided to stop working there by December 2018. I I have no idea where life will take me after that‚Ä¶

Most likely I am the most chaotic traveler you will ever meet. When I travel I do not plan anything in advance, I book the ticket and off I go. I get lost a LOT, but luckily I somehow always end up where I need to be. My memory is like a sieve. If I don‚Äôt write things down or record them I am most likely to forget them.

This is why I write. This is why my GoPro has basically grown onto my right arm. This is why I‚Äôve kept a diary for every single travel for the past 7 years.

I lost my memory once while riding Downhill. I recovered, but one thing that stayed is the inability to tell which month I am in. Seriously if you would tell me right now ‚ÄúFor February it is pretty hot‚Äù I would not question it at all and just nod in blind consent. Adding to that my attention span is so terribly bad I can barely listen to any word after 10 minutes, but I will most likely perfectly mirror the mimics and appear to be taking all in. I am the female version of the Scrubs guy.

Hahaha, well the whole thing is actually not too bad. Having fallen on my head (quoting my uncle who is pretty sure I‚Äôve hit my head looong before that accident) I got much more intuitive, which is very useful for a female solo traveler...

China Tour Video Playlist: 
About This Tour - - - 
1. First stop: Yu Garden or Yuyuan Garden
Most probably the most populated area in Shanghai, Yu Market is one of the major tourist spots in Shanghai. Though the spot is overly crowded, the Garden of Happiness really has a charm of its own. Built by Pan Yunduan of Ming Dynasty 1559, Yuyuan Garden is the largest and most prestigious of its kind during that era. 
2. Second stop: Yu Garden Bazaar or Yuyuan Market
Very close to Yuyuan Garden lies one of the most lively food markets in Shanghai. Well, not just a food market, but a large market space with almost everything in the menu. While some of us were busy gathering souvenirs I went on exploring food in Yuyuan Market. 
3. Monument to the People's Heroes: it  is located at the north end of the Bund where the Suzhou Creek joins the Huangpu River. The structure was built in 1993 to commemorate revolutionary martyrs. 
5. Oriental Pearl TV Tower: Located at the the tip of Lujiazui by the side of Huangpu River, TV tower which is also known as the glass tower of Shanghai is another major tourism attraction in the city. You can go up to the 263 meters high platform to get an amazing view of the city and the river. If you need more, climb down to the 259 meters high platform to walk over a glass platform to see the city beneath your feet. 
6. Huangpu River Cruise: To conclude a day in thrill just hit the Huangpu River banks for a cruise. In Shanghai you need to experience the speed (Maglev Magnetic Train), the height (Shanghai Glass Tower), and the lights (Huangpu River Cruise). You will get an idea about it as you watch the video.",travel

3yD57Oo0ykY,"Travel Blog Sayulita Mexico - Good vibes, good times and beautiful hidden beaches","Daily Travel Vlog #78 - Today is a new day backpacking through Sayulita. Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for a new day and new adventure!!!

How to Vlog? This is the question I asked myself as I started out the new year. I am always looking to be more creative and I decided that this year will be the year that I start a daily vlog. So sitback and step into my daily life. 

Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring. 

A little bit about myself: 
I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.

My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon. We traveled to last year all around Mexico, China, Bali, Hawaii and throughout California and Neveda. I am hoping that 2016 will bring more excitement and more travels, so be sure to subscribe :)

JUJ9b-8fOzQ,üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog,"üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - Roti (also known as chapati) is a flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta, that originated and is consumed in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Maldives, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It is also consumed in parts of South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, the southern Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Indian naan bread, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread. A kulcha in Indian cuisine is a bread-like accompaniment, made of processed flour (maida) leavened with yeast. The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ (ro·π≠ikƒÅ), meaning ""bread"".[4] Names in other languages are Hindi: ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä; Assamese: ‡ß∞‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡ßÄ; Nepali : ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü‡•Ä; Bengali: ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶ø; Sinhalese: ‡∂ª‡∑ú‡∂ß‡∑í; Gujarati: ‡™∞‡´ã‡™ü‡™≤‡´Ä; Marathi: ‡§™‡•ã‡§≥‡•Ä; Odia: ‡¨∞‡≠Å‡¨ü‡¨ø; Malayalam: ‡¥±‡µä‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø; Kannada: ‡≤∞‡≥ä‡≤ü‡≥ç‡≤ü‡≤ø; Telugu: ‡∞∞‡±ä‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞ø; Tamil: ‡Æ∞‡Øä‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø; Urdu: ÿ±ŸàŸπ€å; Punjabi: ‡®∞‡©ã‡®ü‡©Ä,‡®´‡©Ç‡®≤‡®ï‡®æ; Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏µ. It is also known as maani in Sindhi, ruti in Bengali and phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki. In Sri Lanka, probably the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is Kottu roti. Kottu roti is made up of paratha or godamba roti . Paratha/godamba roti is cut into small pieces. These pieces are small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables, onions are allowed to be fried. Then eggs, cooked meat or fish are added to fried vegetables and allowed to be heated for a few minutes. Finally the pieces of cut paratha is added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done[citation needed]. It is said that the first person who innovated kottu roti to save the remaining paratha at his restaurant made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy[citation needed]. Depending upon what ingredients are used, there are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton and fish kottu roti.",travel

Lovely stained glass windows followed me as I walked from the bold geometric floors onto a natural footpath through flowering trees to the Transfer Suite.  This is a wonderfully restored luxury boutique property located just on the edge of the UNESCO protected world heritage site, in heart of downtown Georgetown.

Why You'll Love Hotel Penaga:
- Transfer Suites are quiet and charming, with wonderfully curated antiques inside and an open balcony perfect for sipping your morning coffee
- Cinnamon Restaurant and Bar is 100% for foodies.  I ate so well there, and enjoyed a few of the best lemongrass martinis I've ever sipped!

I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. 

SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! 

Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog! Keep watching till the end for that :)

i2-8UEW4M,Langkawi | Sunset Dinner Cruise with Naam Adventures | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"It's a pretty safe bet that I'm going to be signing up for anything that includes wine, a dinner cruise, and an absolutely memorable, picture-perfect sunset.  When I landed on Langkawi and started asking around at the Meritus Pelangi Beach for recommendations on the best cruise operator, the team there shared that they favour Naam and recommended their 3-hour evening dinner cruise on the Sea Falcon so I signed up to go a few days later.  Since I was just one person and staying at the jungle hotel Ambong Ambong (and not one of the main luxury properties they have scheduled pickups at), they provided very swish transfer service in a shiny black sedan that felt wonderfully VIP following days of vans and taxis.

Ohhhh and it turns out I was the only non-Chinese guest aboard that night and I had a hoot and a half!  The wine was flowing, the food was actually really yummy, and the ambiance on the Sea Falcon was perfect.  A bit of a party at the beginning, and then we went into a chill-out vibe closer to sunset.

NOTE: for the first time in over a year, I accidentally deleted the video footage I shot on my Nikon while transferring files.  So, what you'll see is still fun but it's sadly an 'Angela show' because it's what I shot from my iPhone.  I'm so sad, as I shot some amazing footage that night.  Anyway, do check it out, it's just missing the long shots and food and boat interior images.

For more information, links to Naam, and some fun pics visit my travel blog:

35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 

'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. 

In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. 

This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. 

In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: 

As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!",travel

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar, Pakistan. Peshawar is one of the oldest market towns in the world and has one of the richest street food scenes you'll ever witness! You need to travel to Pakistan!

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

When ready, browse vacation packages to New York City: 


 is an international metropolis built on the shoulders of immigrants and their descendants.

The city is home to eight million people, and receives more than 50 million visitors per year. Your New York City  should include sampling the food of hundreds of different cultures. You can easily  on foot, by taxi, or via the famous subway system.

No New York  is complete without a visit to Times Square, which you‚Äôve no doubt seen in many movies. Take in its billboards, its many people, and its food, then cross over to Central Park, which comprises 850 acres of lakes and meadows, and is the setting for many a romantic comedy. 

You also have your pick of art and history museums, as well as the Reflecting Absence Memorial and Museum, where you can pay your respects to the victims of 9/11.


For now, we hope you enjoy watching this   as much as we enjoyed making it.

zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

Yl-LkqYus4,Next Travel Series Revealed,"Where are we traveling to next? We've booked our trip and the next travel series is revealed! You'll have to watch to the end of the video to find out ;)

We're going to GREECE! We've booked a two month stay in the country and we are so excited to film our Greece travel series for you guys. Greece was always a travel destination that was on our list, but we found a really easy direct flight from New York to Athens and haven't looked back since! We are really excited to be back in tropical vacation mode, although you all know we work full time either way.

First we will start with the greek islands, Crete in particular, and then head north to Athens to explore the main land. We will be in Greece for the first time so any suggestions are welcomed in the comments! 

Thanks and hope you are as excited as we are for the new youtube travel series coming to our channel in October! Until then, seeya!

GNVUWyvDiCM,"Family Travel Blog-Three Deaf Backpackers- My Heroes, Siem Reap, Cambodia","http://www.thenomadicfamily.com

So, slowly, slowly; we're unraveling a life together, you and I. I talk a lot, and you've become one hell of a great listener. I appreciate that. 

Anna (the younger one) in Peru spoke of her father's favorite poem. Something about how every man has his first kiss and his first snowfall, and it stuck to me, really snugly. And like you, I have mine. I have my stories that make me who I am, that create the fibers that define where I've been, that push me passed the pain to create who I want to be.

But, according to Buddhism, that 'me' is but only an allusion. Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, and it's what we hold onto, to help us define ourselves, label us, categorize and witness our own journey. But, Buddhism teaches that this false sense of self creates boundaries to spirituality and barriers to the true oneness with the world. It's 'me' 'my story' 'my pain' 'my life' and 'you'; likewise, I can stay flapping around lost in the winds of my own self, the way I was, who I was, who I am, who I will be- all false identities I use to mask my true, true non-self, anatta.

Of course, remember there's Gabi the traveler who is spiritual, and Gabi and spiritual who is traveling. I get confused. And, here too, ever so slowly, I'm learning how to differentiate them and know which articles to put here on thenomadicfamily and which ones at gabiklaf. So, if you'd like to learn more about spirituality, finding that peace and inner light, anatta (non-self) and ways to find her- go there to gabiklaf. :-) 

And our tale continues....

So, I have a story. And this blog allows me to share that with you, unraveling meticulously, one glorious string at a time, all the fibers that make me me. So, this is part of my story, my life-long fascination has always been deaf people. I fall in love with them, like I fall in love with people who work in book stores (Sheryl), librarians, Momma and Poppa old-fashion stores (especially with art and writing supplies), and firemen (but that's a whole different like of love, we don't have to get into right now). My entire life, I see someone signing and I'm stuck standing there, a bit too closely, with my jaw dropped and fairy dust parading before my eyes. A deaf person signing is the mute piped piper swaying his hands to the beat of the tune only her hears. He and me. 

So, it all starts like this. Kobi's sitting in the lobby of our hostel here in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He hands me a note (that I still carry in my notebook and look at every few days). It reads: 

""I saw your site, loved it. My friends and I admire you guys for what you all are doing. Keep up with the blog and continue to travel the world! ""

The note comes from Tandy Lewis, Shayna Unger, and Danielle Berrigan. Hand to heart, I look up. Kobi says, ""They're right over there,"" and I was lost in their music from that moment forth. Forget their kind ways, their shining faces and good looks, their interest in their fellow man, their ability to come right out and say kind things to encourage others; THEY ARE DEAF! That's it, deaf, deaf, deaf, and backpacking. 

OMG did my kids see mommy go into this strange metamorphosis. Years before we had kids and during a summer when (I can't recall exactly why) but I don't think I was working on the ice cream trucks; I enrolled in American Sign Language 101. It was an intensive 4-hour a day summer course. Walk in, day one, teacher is deaf. Here we go. 

So, sitting in the lobby in the middle of Cambodia, signing. I touched things that were precious and lost to me. A language I once knew, rather well. A language we had taught our three babies so that they could effectively communicate their needs before their mouth muscles knew how to voice words. We did baby sign in our home for years. 

And, remarkably fast, it came back. I was standing there talking to these amazing ladies, but not really, really there. I was somewhere else that I'd known long ago, but still can't define. I was in that silent world that somehow lights a voice in my soul that reveals a joy I do not know otherwise. It's a weird magic, and one I am grateful for the girls for bringing out again.

Now, Murphy would have it that during the absolutely most endearing (this one or debate ably the 'Angel Outside of Consumerist Hell') interview for me personally, the camera would shut off. So, you only see two minutes of six... Maybe that's meant to show me that my Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, is an allusion, just like my actually recording of this kick-ass, unreal interview was too. 


Enjoy it, and it's brevity. I did.

1n2QV6Yjl,Penang | The Edison Heritage Boutique Hotel | Asia Luxury Travel Blog,"'Hell yeah' is pretty much the response you'll hear from me anytime I realise that the heritage hotels outnumber the large five star hotels in a city.  I absolutely adore them.  And The Edison joins the list of my favourite hotels in Penang because they have perfectly renovated their glorious property into a modern heritage hotel that respects its historic architecture yet embraces today's trends in comfort and style.

Why You'll Love The Edison
- The Edison is chic, charming, and classy.  It is bright and welcoming during the day, and romantic and assuring at night.
It sits in the heart of downtown Georgetown, located next to two of my all-time favourite spots in town: Red Garden -- a local street food pavilion with live music nightly -- and the lovely Spanish tapas and wine bar Georgetown Wines
- The Lounge is open 24 hours and serves up complimentary snacks and refreshments just like a VIP Executive Club.  And the coffee there is GREAT!

XOXO ~ Angela

DcjW-7CocD,"Markets, Malls and Marts Travel Blog: The Brunel Swindon","In this episode of Markets, Malls and Marts Travel Blog I visit the The Brunel, a shopping mall located in the centre of Swindon and occupying 60% of the town centre area.  I have always liked this place with the usual (and unusual) range of retail outlets, it's clean and bright and very accessible.  Later this year a new food hub will be opening that will certainly add value to it. One wonders how the rest of the town will be impacted but the Management seem genuinely honest and open about two way working with the retailers whether outside or inside the mall. 

Opening in 1973 the uniqueness was three fold: 1) a unique black and white tiling to the then single storey  2) the delivery area located on the roof, which removes the need for lorries to enter the pedestrianised sections to unload.   3) shops have a unique outward/street facing frontage.

Sardinia Italy is one of the most beautiful places in the world!  As we walked along the coastline of Sardinia, the smell of fresh bougainvillea permeated the air as though we had entered a secret serene garden. The sun shined down onto the crystal clear cerulean Sea, illuminating the waters and creating a sparkle effect, dancing in unison on the surface. This was not the Italy we knew before. This was an entirely new world to explore. This was Sardinia.

Just south of Corsica France, Sardinia‚Äôs coast had been beckoning us to visit for years, as though it knew we would fall in love with this Mediterranean island lifetimes before stepping onto it. The northeastern coastline of Sardinia, known as the Costa Smeralda, is notorious as the playground for sailing and the rich & famous. Yachts flood the glamorous town of Porto Cervo in the summer months and create an alternate utopian universe for Europe‚Äôs bourgeois to rub shoulders. While the Costa Smeralda may be known as the summer playground for the elite, there is so much more that it offers.
We try to help you decide:
Where to stay in sardinia
What to do in sardinia
Where to eat in sardinia
Where to go in Porto Cervo

Today I could have gone surfing, hiking, exploring the National Park, had coffee at the market, and gone salsa dancing, but really what I needed to do was sit in a hammock and just enjoy it.  While traveling it's easy to get caught up in doing what the guidebook, or all the other travelers say you should be doing, but just like in life, you don't need to listen to that.

No matter where your travels take you, remember that you don't have to fall into doing what society tells you, and you should put yourself first, especially if you ever plan on serving other people.

It's good if you've not been, as lots of the animals are close, including feeding the deer and interaction with monkeys as they destroy your car.

FXVZnPYLX8k,Langkawi | Casa Del Mar 5 Star Beach Hotel | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"From the moment I caught sight of the charming architecture, the bold colours contrasting the blue sky, and my personal garden, I couldn't tell if I was Italy or Spain but somehow I was instantly transported back to the Med.  Then I turned around and my heart knew I was on the UNESCO World Geopark site of Langkawi, at the lovely Casa Del Mar.  This quaint five star hotel is home to just 34 rooms, making our stay an intimate affair where the staff remembers our usual order, knows our likes and dislikes, and instantly acts like we're part of the family.  In fact, this luxury property exudes such a chilled and relaxed vibe that I didn't fuss over how I looked once and simply relaxed throughout my entire stay.

Set on the pristine Pantai Cenang beach, Casa Del Mar Langkawi is just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport and with lots of shopping and dining all around.  The cosy feeling of check-in on overstuffed sofas begins the chilled experience you'll feel throughout your stay.

They have fun surprises like shelves upon shelves of books organised by language and a huge DVD library that you can simply walk up to and select what you'd like, which I did a couple of times and loved.

URi_SsP,"How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly","How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlog

Becoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.

A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:

1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.

Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.

There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, 

Guest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:

2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.

Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.


This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEO
Ho to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:

SEO 1 - 
SEO 2 - kw - 
SEO 3 - OnPage - 
SEO 4 - OffPage -  

3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etc


Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.

Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.

As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out  - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.

But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.

WPpzhWSE6ng,Family Travel and Sailing Blogs about Exploring the World by Sea and Living your Dream,"Our new CHANNEL AD.!

A decade of planning, saving and sacrifice to eventually live the dream of traveling the world by sea.  We sold all our belongings, quit our jobs, rented the house, took the kids out of school and searched for the best cruising boat we could afford, before we were finally ready to go sail the world's oceans.

Our family vlogs tell the story of the amazing people we meet, the strange places we visit and the travel and adventures we have along the way. But they are also about the everyday trials and tribulations of trying to live off-grid, of remote working, making money as we travel, shopping, cooking, boat maintenance, home schooling, living on a budget and the everyday challenges of family life afloat.

We'd love you to SUBSCRIBE to our channel and SHARE our adventure with friends and family who might just need that little nudge to step outside their comfort zone to live their dream too.. and perhaps learn a little from our mistakes!

We vlogged (video blogged) our day trip to Giethoorn, also widely regarded as Venice of The Netherlands or Venice of the North. We rented boats and toured the canals of the city. 

Giethoorn is charming with many channels and boats. Many tourists come here to relax and go to the nearby national park.

About a year ago Chinese tourists discovered Giethoorn. They come by tourist buses or local buses. The whole city is getting adjusted to the Chinese tourists, they are learning Chinese, have Chinese written menus and signs, and even the bus tickets for the public transport buses are now written in Chinese. But not only does Chinese tourists come here, Indians, Americans, Thai and other tourists started to discover Giethoorn too.

If you prefer a more quiet place you should check out our blog about Kalenberg.

LEsLDtUvf,"One Day in Verona, Italy: How to See Everything","Start at the bottom and work your way up. You'll see all the Romeo and Juliet sites, including where they lived and where they got married, along with the best views in Verona and amazing churches and piazzas.

Be sure to subscribe to see all our adventures around the world: 

As you can see at the end of the video, we had time to spare. So if you want to go up the Torre dei Lamberti or go into the Arena, you can. Just make sure you watch your times, since ALL THE CHURCHES CLOSE AT 5pm, with a siesta break from 1-.

You can easily see the entire city in one day. We started at the bottom (San Zeno and Castelvecchio) and zig-zagged our way up to the top, ending at the viewpoint (at Piazzale Castel San Pietro) for sunset. A little better planning would reduce the amount of walking we did (we covered more than 30,000 steps), but the town is so small that you can get across the entire thing in about 15 minutes.

Here is a list of everything we saw and the corresponding timestamps:

 - Basilica San Zeno (where Romeo and Juliet got married)
 - Castelvecchio
 - Castelvecchio Bridge (aka Ponte Scaligero) - medieval bridge with the world's largest arch (at the time it was built)
 - Piazza Bra
 - Arena di Verona (it opens late on Mondays - at pm, every other day is am-pm)
 - Via Mazzini
 - Porta Borsari
 - Arco dei Gavi
 - Lunch at Baccha Bundus (fantastic piadinas)
 - Piazza della Erbe
 - Piazza della Ragione
 - Torre dei Lamberti
 (and ) - Casa di Giulietta (Juliet's House)
 - Porta Leoni
 - San Fermo (upper church)
 - San Fermo (lower church)
 - Casa di Romeo
 - Sant'Anastasia
 - Duomo di Verona (Verona Cathedral
 - St. Elena
 - The baptistry (St Giovanni in Fonte)
 - Scaliger Tombs (Tombs of the della Scala family)
 - Santa Maria Antica
 and  - Ponte Pietra
 - Piazzale Castel San Pietro (Best view in Verona)
 - Dante's statue in Piazza dei Signori

This is the final day of our 11-day trip through Europe. Check out the whole trip here:

lY-TDyj9d7A,How to Eat a Beaver Tail üá®üá¶ | Ottawa Travel Blog 2018,"Follow me on insta:  http://bit.ly/2xbKw3o
I would not be Candy Kid Canada if I didn't make a video about a true Canadian classic dessert.  If you are in Canada you have to eat a Beaver Tail! 

Wait, it's not what you think!  Beaver Tails is the name they give to a Canadian pastry.  The best place to get a Beaver Tail is from BeaverTails and this is what their website says:  BeaverTails is truly one of a kind. Irresistibly delicious, artisanal Canadian pastry, always there to share special moments that make lifelong memories. Iconic indulgence since 1978, today we continue our heritage by uniquely combining our original recipe with premium quality ingredients. Served piping-hot, our hand-stretched whole-wheat pastries are both crispy and chewy at the same time. With endless flavour combinations, we promise you an experience you will never forget.

The BeaverTails we visited is located right in the heart of Byward Market in Ottawa.  Great place to sit and watch people!

7uY0Ab5HlZ0,Toronto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Toronto.d17831...

Welcome to Toronto, the largest city in Canada and a hub of trade and culture.

‚ÄúThe City That Works‚Äù is full of a can-do spirit that is reflected in its buildings. From the famous CN Tower to the castle-like Casa Loma, there‚Äôs all sorts of eye candy for the architecture enthusiast. Your Toronto tour should include a trip to Edward Gardens in Hyde Park, or one of the many other green spaces located in the city. Take a bike ride along the trails, or enjoy a picnic while the local chipmunks look on. Don‚Äôt drop anything; they‚Äôll grab it.

Your Toronto sightseeing can continue at the Harborfront Center. Go for a walk along the marina, or grab a pint at a brewhouse. And no trip to Toronto is complete without a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame, so make sure you‚Äôve got your team paraphernalia in order before you venture inside. Looking for shopping? You‚Äôll find the Underground City and Kensington Market ready to welcome you and your credit card ‚Äì or several credit cards, as the case may be. After a day of madcap purchasing, why not stock up on fresh, healthy food at the St. Lawrence Market? You‚Äôll have worked up quite an appetite for delicious local produce. 

Before you leave, head to Niagara Falls and take in the spectacle of nature‚Äôs power. You‚Äôll never forget the sight and sound of all that water pouring over the falls, nor will you ever forget your trip to Toronto.

The other day I was reading GlobalGirlTravels and I saw the bold claim ""Don't Start a Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown"".

Is this true?

What would Chinese people do? And would they start a blog in an apparently saturated niche like the travel one?

Well I'm currently living in China so I have a unique take on the situation...

If you have one day to eat, this German food tour of Munich will give you some serious satisfaction. I have to admit, I going to multiple back to back restaurants to eat German food is a challenge - German food is so hearty and so filling. By the end of this food tour in Munich, I was ready to sleep immediately!

Here are all the details about the restaurants and prices of the dishes I ate:

1. Andy's Krablergarten
Andy's Krablergarten is known for their schnitzel, and they serve it up in a huge way. The cutlets are made from pork, and they are big and fried fresh. I tried a Hamburg schnitzel with eggs and a Munich style schnitzel with horseradish in the breading. It was fantastic. 
Address: Thalkirchner Str. 2, 80337 M√ºnchen, Germany
Price: 10.90 EUR per schnitzel

2. Andechser am Dom
This is a nice German food restaurant, located on the side of Munich Frauenkirche, a  major landmark in the heart of Munich. They serve a variety of traditional German Bavarian cuisine. My favorite dish was the mixed sausage plate, but the leberk√§se was also good.
Address: Weinstra√üe 7A, 80333 M√ºnchen, Germany
Total price: 36.30 EUR

3. Ice cream at Schuhbeck's Eissalon
Address: Pfisterstra√üe 11, 80331 M√ºnchen, Germany

4. Bergwolf
Bergwolf is a German fast food restaurant in Munich, and their speciality is currywurst, a plate of sausage topped in sauce and fries. It‚Äôs not the healthiest of all German dishes, but it sure tastes pretty amazing - one of those 3 am kind of dishes.
Address: Fraunhoferstra√üe 17, 80469 M√ºnchen, Germany
Price: 5.40 EUR

5. Augustiner Br√§ustuben
Augustiner Br√§ustuben is a classic German brewery and restaurant in Munich, Germany. You‚Äôll find some very classic Bavarian dishes on their menu and a good selection of beer.
Address: Landsberger Str. 19, 80339 M√ºnchen, Germany
Total price: 24.25 EUR

Thank you for watching this German food tour of Munich. I hope it will provide you with some tips on where to eat amazing German food when you‚Äôre in Munich!

7Hk7PkV-Fb0,"Jubril Agoro ""How I Really Make Money "" Travel Blogging ?","People keep asking me this:

""Jubril, how do you make money and still travel the world?""

I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...

Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:
And you are invited, you can register for free below



Also, some things have really changed...
..and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...

The number one way I make money is:

#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:
I come up with the marketing material, write the ads, then run the ad campaigns for them.

This is by far the most profitable and believe me, most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...

But they're not...
You just have to know how to write them.

A perfect example is my client Tiffany...

...she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.

Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.

*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*
[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]
My secret?

Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]

But there‚Äôs more...

#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.

All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that‚Äôs your thing. It can be that simple...

#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.

[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]

#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here‚Äôs how it works:

When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.

#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.

Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...
Here is what you need to know:

Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads...

...he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me...
...then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...

Over million dollars in revenue.

So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?

If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.

Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I‚Äôm going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you...

...what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.

You can get all of that right here:


[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]

If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.

I'll see you there,

TsVRtFWveY,Visit Italy - The DON'Ts of Visiting Italy,"Read the Blog on What Tourists Should Not Do When They Visit Italy: https://woltersworld.com/12-things-to...
GRAB A WOLTERS WORLD SHIRT  http://www.woltersworld.com/shop
What You Shouldn't Do When You Are in Italy 
Visiting Italy is an amazing experience whether you are seeing the Roman ruins throughout the country in places like Rome or Naples, but for all the amazing things you should do in Italy (visit Venice, Florence, Rome, Ravenna, Amalfi Coast, eat until you explode) there are things you DON'T DO when you come to Italy & Here are our 12 things NOT TO DO in Italy when you are traveling Italy. 
Filmed in Vicenza, Italy
Copyright Mark Wolters 2016

The Don'ts of Italy
1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 

2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights. 
 
3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 
4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 
5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.
6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 
7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.
8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 
9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 
10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 
11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 
12. Don't expect to be served food in a restaurant between 3pm and 7pm.

87If-Q2pJWQ,Philippines Street Food - AMAZING Filipino Food at Aling Sosing's Carinderia in Manila!,"One of the best Filipino food meals you can eat in Manila!
‚ñ∫Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you‚Äôre a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you‚Äôll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you‚Äôre eating, and it‚Äôs fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don‚Äôt cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I‚Äôve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it‚Äôs every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you‚Äôre looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you‚Äôre going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

When ready, browse vacation packages to Singapore: 


Small and heavily populated,  is an easy place to ; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots. 

Your Singapore  must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you‚Äôre a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species. You can also take a ‚Äúbumboat‚Äù from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves. 

No Singapore  is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In this food tour, Mina and I discovered authentic North Korean food in Seoul. Seoul is only 50 km from North Korea, and home to many North Koreans, some of whom have opened restaurants in the city. I‚Äôve been to Seoul many times, but never had any like these unique North Korean dishes before. Naengmyeon is known to be one of the most common North Korean foods, but we wanted to try a few other lesser known North Korean dishes as well.

Here are the North Korean restaurants we ate at on this food tour:

Dongmu Bapsang (ÎèôÎ¨¥Î∞•ÏÉÅ) - This is where you can order the giant platter of rainbow noodles, and I would strongly recommend it. They pour the soup tableside, and it‚Äôs such a refreshing dish. Additionally the Sundae, Korean blood sausage, was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Total price - 61,000 KRW ($51.63)

Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) - Situated just off the main road in an unassuming small house like building Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) specializes mostly in North Korean bowls of noodles and mandu dumplings. The food was very good, tasted handmade, and the restaurant feels very homely. The owner really warmed up to us, and as we left, even insisted that we take umbrellas. Total price - 44,000 KRW ($34.70)

Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) - Finally, the third restaurant on this North Korean food tour of Seoul, we went to Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) to eat Naengmyeon noodles, and this massive pan of beef hot pot with herbs. Total price - 104,000 KRW ($88.03) 

Overall, North Korean food seems very pure, some things with less flavor, a little more plain, yet still flavorful and focusing on the natural ingredients without extras. Taking this North Korean food tour of Seoul was a fun experience, especially hanging out and eating with Mina.

- Can I use this music in my videos?

To use this music in your videos or media projects, you must first purchase a license from the link above.

- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?

'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. This is a common misconception on the Internet, and especially here on YouTube. You can read further into what ""royalty-free music"" means here: ...

- Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?

Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to us in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use our music on your videos, which is also needed if you're looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.

FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,"Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of ‚Äúthe beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution‚Äù. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‚Äòclean coal technologies‚Äô, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China‚Äôs changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‚Äòcatching up‚Äô of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China‚Äôs emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country‚Äôs ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham‚Äôs perspectives on this process. 
The talk was part of the China Sussex Seminar Series ",science and technology

BAhHZ1Gi9Kk,10 Oldest Technologies Scientists Still Can‚Äôt Explain,"Thousands of years ago great minds managed to create incredible technologies that were way ahead of their time, like a fire that couldn‚Äôt be extinguished by water, an unbreakable medieval sword, and even an ancient computer from 200 B.C.E.! You‚Äôd be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can‚Äôt explain today.  If you‚Äôre ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more, then keep on watching. 

TIMESTAMPS
The stone globes of Costa Rica 
The Roman dodecahedron 
The Phaistos Disk in Crete 
Greek fire 
Damascus steel 
The Iron pillar of Delhi 
The Viking Ulfberht sword 
The Voynich manuscript 
The Zhang Heng seismograph 
The Antikythera mechanism 

  

Music: 


SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid‚Äôs toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that‚Äôs because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn‚Äôt more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn‚Äôt come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth‚Äôs movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first analog computer‚Äù and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

A large group of science, technology and innovation studies scholars is making a significant contribution to the report Rethinking Society for the 21st Century, produced by the International Panel on Social Progress. The Panel seeks to answer the question: Can we hope for a better society in the very challenging context of a series of system crises, growing inequality and climate change? To answer this question the IPSP has mobilised hundreds of social scientists (including economists) to provide answers and to deliver a report. It will have 22 chapters and address major issues, including: Social Justice, Inequality, Cities, Jobs, Markets, Finance, Corporations, Democracy, Sexuality, Violence, Wars, Peace and Security, and Multiple Directions of Social Progress. In the final chapter the report will discuss the contribution of social sciences to policy and institutional change. The Panel claims that it has no partisan political agenda, but aims at restoring hope in social progress and stimulating intellectual and public debates.",science and technology

dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It‚Äôs an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new ‚Äúthings‚Äù and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ‚Äô90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you‚Äôre a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we‚Äôre being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we‚Äôre not exaggerating at all.

Whenever we think of Technology and Inventions, we immediately recall names like Newton, Tesla, Graham Bell, and Thomas Edison. If we talk about the modern day inventors, then Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two names that immediately come to mind. However, not many people know that Pakistani scientists have also made many contributions to the world of science and technology. We have compiled a list of ten amazing inventions of Pakistani scientists. Enjoy this video in Urdu.

NH-VSWGksQ,Exploring Japan's cutting edge science and technology!,"Science Square Tsukuba: http://www.aist.go.jp/sst/en/
IbakiraTV: https://www.youtube.com/ibaraki

The local government in Ibaraki gave us free reign for three days to film whatever places we wanted, and our second stop was Science Square Tsukuba, a showcase of the cutting edge technologies being researched at AIST (The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology). There were A LOT of displays! We mainly filmed the areas that were somewhat interactive to make for a more engaging video, but there was a lot of really interesting information on what technologies are being developed right now! There's information in English on touchscreens next to all the displays and it is not dumbed down for anyone! I super recommend this center if you love science and technology.

This is part of Tsukuba Science City, which is a planned city in Japan that aggregates scientific academies, research institutions, museums, and even JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency--Japan's version of NASA). It's right next to the geology museum, and a few blocks away is Tsukuba Expo Center, the site of the 1985 Science Exposition. It now hosts Japan's largest observatory and planetarium. And right near that is the Tsukuba Space Center, one of Tsukuba's most popular attractions. If you're into science and technology at all, Tsukuba Science City is a must!!

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed charge in 2014, he called on these institutions to work together for national transformation. Over the last four and a half years, one of his focus areas has been to enable the use of science to fuel development.

With this view, the government has taken multiple initiatives to link technology and science with the life of a common man. Today, India ranks 6th in scientific publications and 10th for patents. The number of patent applications filed by the Indian scientists and inventors increased to 47,857 in 2018. 

Today in IN DEPTH, we look at the various initiatives of the NDA-govt led by PM Modi in the field of science and technology, the budgetary allocations to these sectors in the previous financial year and the expectations in the upcoming Budget.",science and technology

 #HISAChallenge

We created this video in the hopes of expanding our knowledge of space and technologies. In this video, we talk of the many influences space and technology has on humanity. We discuss, how certain technologies intended for use in space also have practical uses here in everyday life. Our in depth interviews with Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI institute and Dr. Brian Mendez of UC Berkeley gave us a strong understanding of this topic.

VL-YNAb_uX,Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century,"Steven Pinker - ""The Sense of Style: Scientific Communication for the 21st Century""

Harvard College Professor, and Johnstone Family Professor, Department of Psychology, Harvard University

Abstract: Let's face it: most scientists are terrible communicators. Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)

The first annual Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering lecture about communicating complex scientific and technological subjects clearly and engagingly in the series : Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century.

_RV-ITIYpAE,Creative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from,"Google Tech Talk
May 14, 2009

ABSTRACT

Creative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from Visual Arts.  Presented by Dr. Julio M. Ottino.

Creativity is essential in art, in science, and in technology. But in what way is creativity different in these three areas, and in what way is it similar? Technology is about invention, making and building; science is about unveiling, revealing what may already be there. Philosophers, placing the emphasis on uniqueness, have declared that science is ephemeral and that art is permanent, and have placed artistic creation on the highest plane. Others have taken the same viewpoint. However, is this actually true? Or more pragmatically, are there creative processes and lessons that can be transferred across domains? In what ways do the domains intersect and enrich each other? Julio M. Ottino argues that artistic creativity reveals processes that hold lessons for scientific and technological creativity. 

Dr. Julio M. Ottino is the dean of the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Northwestern University where he holds the titles of Distinguished Robert R. McCormick Institute Professor and Walter P. Murphy Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Born in Argentina he had a career as an artist before he moved to the U.S. for his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He then held a faculty position at UMass/Amherst and held chaired and senior appointments at Caltech, Stanford, and the University of Minnesota. He joined Northwestern in 1991 and was chairman of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering from 1992 to 2000. He was the founder and co-director of the Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems.",science and technology

Lecture Abstract:  
As human population is growing faster than ever, access to reliable and sustainable energy has become one of the most important problems in the 21st century. Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.

Germany has been the home of some of the most prominent researchers in various scientific disciplines, notably physics, mathematics, chemistry and engineering,...
  * ""Metallurgical Engineering""
Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys. Metallurgy is also the technology of metals: the way in which science is applied to the production of metals, and the engineering of metal components for usage in products for consumers and manufacturers. The production of metals involves the processing of ores to extract the metal they contain, and the mixture of metals, sometimes with other elements, to produce alloys. Metallurgy is distinguished from the craft of metalworking, although metalworking relies on metallurgy, as medicine relies on medical science, for technical advancement...",science and technology

STS combines history of science, philosophy of science, sociology of science, science policy, science communication and other fields into one combined field of study. We look at how science shapes the world, and how the world shapes science - and we use approaches from the humanities to understand how science interacts with society. 

UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies offers two undergraduate degrees. History and Philosophy of Science, and (new for 2019) Sociology and Politics of Science - as well as MSc and PhD level study.

When you think of the word ""robot,"" you probably picture social 'bots like Rosie, the Jetson's maid, and Star Wars' C-3PO. Cynthia Breazeal, an Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, is working to make your humanoid robot dreams a reality. Dr. Breazeal is the founder and director of the Personal Robots Group at MIT's Media Lab, a program that develops the techniques and technologies necessary to develop personal robots.

Her most famous robot is Kismet, the first robot designed to engage humans in expressive, natural interactions. Kismet, built as part of Breazeal's doctoral thesis at MIT, was dubbed one of the ""50 Best Robots Ever"" by Wired Magazine in 2006. Other robots emerging from Breazeal's lab include Leonardo, another expressive robot; Autom, a robot designed to help people lose weight; and RoCo, a robotic computer that can adjust its ""posture."" So if you see a friendly robot walking down the street 20 years from now, Breazeal might be partially to thank. ‚ÄîAriel Schwartz

EEz9CQKuvE,What if technologies shaped the law? [Science and Technology podcast],"Œïxploring the relationship between law, technological innovation and regulatory governance has always been a challenging task for policy-makers. Technologies are often seen as ordinary objects of formal law that can fit into the traditional doctrinal classification. But what if technologies were legal artefacts that question and challenge the traditional boundaries of legal thought? Some scholars even argue that technology is law, given that the employment of technology for control purposes in regulation provides opportunities to directly or indirectly shape human behaviour in legal terms. However, it is difficult to determine whether it is technology that challenges the law or the law that shapes or even predefines the development paths of new and emerging technologies.

V66feYKy6_A,"Stephen Hawking: Science & Technology Lecture, Interview - Education (1998)","Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His books: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...

His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Hawking is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his book A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.

Hawking suffers from a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicates using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device. Hawking married twice and has three children.

At the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time, Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[306][307][308] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song ""Keep Talking"",[309][234] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[310] Hawking appeared in documentaries entitled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001),[296] Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002) [311] and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[312] Hawking has also guest-starred in Futurama[72] and The Big Bang Theory.[313] Hawking allowed the use of his trademarked voice in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything.[314]

Hawking has used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[296] National Savings,[315] British Telecom, Specsavers, Egg Banking[316] and Go Compare.[317]

Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). At that time, his nomination read:

    ""Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on ""Space-time in the Large"". The citation continues:

    ""Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.""",science and technology

Nanotechnology is a practice that involves shrinking down objects so that they can perform mechanical, electrical, or chemical processes at a much smaller scale. These small innovations can revolutionise the world, as there are many problems that can be alleviated through the process of miniaturization. There are plenty of issues and challenges that can be addressed by nanotechnology.

The world is changing at a fast rate and it can be hard to understand or keep abreast of the numerous innovations in the tech field. Nanotechnology has huge scope for not only changing the world but also bettering our collective lives.

zdg5iovYR1I,European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) - what's in it for researchers?,"The nature of science has changed. It has become interconnected, collaborative, multidisciplinary and data-intensive.

The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) has been a building block of Europe's research for 45 years. It funds research networks across borders and spanning all scientific disciplines. 

Because science is all about people, COST creates spaces where people are empowered and ideas can grow without limits. It connects people in high-quality networks that deliver value for money and opportunities to excel. This is a flexible and open approach focused on cooperation, which creates a unique dynamic. It creates a fertile ground for science to flourish. 

Academia, industry, public and private sector laboratories work together in networks, sharing knowledge, leveraging diversity and pooling resources.

COST is now more relevant than ever. It is the perfect example of how governments can make a real difference, ensuring that cooperation optimises national investment in research and technology and unlocks the full potential of science.

DakzXQDQUUU,President's Science and Technology Awards 2016 - Event Highlights,"Visit https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Research/Pr... for more information

The prestigious President‚Äôs Science and Technology Awards 2016 was held at the Istana with President Tony Tan Keng Yam presenting awards to this year‚Äôs deserving winners. The annual event honours individuals or groups of individuals for their outstanding contributions in the fields of science and technology. 

The President's Science and Technology Awards (PSTA) are the highest honours bestowed on exceptional research scientists and engineers in Singapore for their excellent achievements in science and technology. The awards are presented to recognise and celebrate outstanding and invaluable contributions by individuals or teams to the research and development landscape in Singapore. 2009 marked the first year that the President's Science and Technology Awards were presented. 

The awards, formerly known as the National Science and Technology Awards since 1987, have been elevated to the status of the President's awards to highlight and give due recognition to the important role research scientists and engineers play in Singapore. The prestige of the President's awards underpins Singapore's efforts to raise the level of excellence in research and strengthen the growing community of scientific talent in Singapore. 

The President's Science and Technology Awards constitute three different awards, namely, the President's Science and Technology Medal, the President's Science Award and the President's Technology Award. The winners of the respective awards have been carefully chosen through a rigorous process by a selection committee comprising key representatives from the government, industry, academia, defence and public research institutes.

The Young Scientist Awards (YSA), administered by the Singapore National Academy of Science (SNAS) and supported by A*STAR, are also presented at the President‚Äôs Science and Technology Awards Ceremony. They are presented to young researchers, aged 35 and below, who are actively engaged in R&D in Singapore, and who have shown great potential to be world-class researchers in their fields of expertise.

f_qq-hX3QM,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Part 1 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.

Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.

HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.

One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.

The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong ‚Äì approx. HKD 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 per year which is very low.

Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology ‚Äì any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.
Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.
The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse ‚Äì he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. 
HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.
HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  
Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.

Eo76-SX5Bck,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology - Part 2 of 2,"Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 2 of 2 videos.

Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.

Coming to Jobs, another advantage of studying in Hong Kong is availability of Jobs, visa, internships etc. Ansh says that jobs in Hong Kong pay a lot, some students can pay their living expenses because of a well-paying job. Most common part time job for students is to become a tutor for other IB students, and this is very well paying and helps take care of boarding and living expenses.
The language requirement for most jobs is English, though they prefer if you know Cantonese. However, there are many students who have well-paying jobs without knowing Chinese. It is very easy to get a work visa once you have studied there, also the job placements are very good. Most international students have job offers in hand a few months before they graduate and very good salaries.
Intense research culture, jobs being available, salaries being good, visas being easily available and cost being low make it a very attractive place to study in.
Asian culture is unique and different from the American and British universities. They are very academic and it is very difficult to score good grades. Students are graded on a curve and it is very tough to get a GPA over 3.0. The Chinese students spend most of their time studying and for them university is about studying. If they pursue any activity they will take up only one activity and pursue it very seriously. They are much focussed.
There is no fraternity culture, there are clubs and societies, though international students are not welcome for most of these. The language is mostly in Chinese. At the Business school lectures are discussion based. In Engineering school there are less international professors, there are more Chinese professors. In their culture subordination is key. Professors at the top, students below. So you are not supposed to question a professor in class. If you give the right answer in class, they think you are showing off. Students don‚Äôt like to speak in class.
Language of Instruction is English, but given 80% Cantonese. Most activities are conducted in Cantonese like clubs, movie nights, trekking activities etc. are all conducted in Cantonese. Most students have learnt English but they find it very difficult to speak in English since English is either their second or third language. So they prefer sticking amongst themselves. Even if they know how to speak in English they are very reluctant, since in their culture if you make a mistake people make fun of you, so they are afraid that the international students will make fun of them so they prefer to speak in Cantonese.
Ansh started learning Cantonese to merge with them, and that made a big difference since they found an international student is trying to learn Cantonese and trying to speak with us, they get more friendly with you. Even with sports, may Indian students do not participate in sports, they are usually more involved in partying or studying. Ansh is one of the few international students who is serious about his extra curriculars. Even mainland Chinese students have always studied in Mandarin so most of them learn English just before coming to college, just to get admission.
The food on campus is local Chinese food that is not very spicy. Food places outside campus can be quite expensive. Ansh travelled around Hong Kong researching good food less than HKD 50 or 100. HE enjoyed the food since Hong Kong is a very diverse place for food, a huge varieties of cuisines. He now tries to cook his own food and became the director of the cuisine society to initiate more activities with people who are as passionate about food.    
The social scene on campus is also very different. Their idea of partying is not drinking and dancing but playing games and eating good food. So most International students go out for partying. In Hong Kong the two main partying areas are Wanchai and Lan Kwan Fong, both have a very international feel, where many international students party. 
Hiking is a great fun activity in Hong Kong. You can hike in the middle of the city, in five minutes you can be from a station to a mountain. There are hiking trails and maps available which make hiking a great activity in Hong Kong.  
‚ÄòCrazy‚Äô is the one word in which he describes his school ‚Äì crazy academic and crazy diverse.

""LLNL just celebrated its 65th anniversary. Since 1952, the laboratory has been at the forefront of high performance computing. Initially, HPC was used to accelerate the design and testing of the nation's nuclear stockpile. Since the last U.S. nuclear test in 1992, HPC has been used to validate the safety, security, and reliability of stockpile without nuclear testing.

Our next flagship HPC system at LLNL will be called Sierra. A collaboration between multiple government and industry partners, Sierra and its sister system Summit at ORNL, will pave the way towards Exascale computing architectures and predictive capability.""

4u3f7_p1i8,Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field,"John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.

Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern World

Vedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.

Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.

Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life‚Äîthe field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.

Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.

Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature‚Äôs functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.

Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well‚Äîthe self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.

This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.

The process of transcending‚Äîmoving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)‚Äîprovides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.

Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)‚Äîthe union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.

This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a ‚Äúwakeful hypo-metabolic state‚Äù of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.

Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.

Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.",science and technology
VvRc_Ba0gk,Birla Planetarium Chennai | Periyar Science and Technology Centre | CutShots,"#Birlaplanetarium

B. M. Birla Planetarium is a large planetarium in Chennai providing a virtual tour of the night sky and holding cosmic shows on a specially perforated hemispherical aluminium inner dome. It is located at Kotturpuram in the Periyar Science and Technology Centre campus which houses eight galleries, namely, Physical Science, Electronics and Communication, Energy, Life Science, Innovation, Transport, International Dolls and Children and Materials Science, with over 500 exhibits. Built in 1988 in the memory of the great industrialist and visionary of India B. M. Birla, it is the most modern planetarium in India.

The planetarium is located in the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre's (TNSTC) Periyar Science and Technology Centre campus on the Gandhi Mandapam Road in Kotturpuram abutting the Central Leather Research Institute campus. It lies close to the Guindy National Park in the predominantly wooded Adyar-Guindy region known as the Green Lungs of Chennai, enabling it to conduct night-sky observation comparatively easily which is otherwise difficult amidst the glaring city lights in the night. Other nearby landmarks include the IIT Madras, Adyar Cancer Institute, Anna University, University of Madras‚ÄìGuindy campus and the Anna Centenary Library. The nearest railway stations are Kotturpuram MRTS in the northeast and Kasturba Nagar MRTS in the southeast, both located at a distance of 1 km from the planetarium.[1] The Kotturpuram bus stop lies 2 km to the north.

zO3HZdejf_U,Science & Technology Policy Fellows: Transforming Global Science,"Over the past 40 years, AAAS S&T Policy Fellows have gone on to top leadership posts in U.S. science policy. In a new video, several alumni discuss the program's global impact. 

In the early 1970s, science-related issues emerged at the center of public debate and at the top of the U.S. political agenda: water and air pollution, energy and nuclear power, the future of the space program. And yet leaders in the U.S. science community, including some at AAAS, realized that Congress and other policy agencies lacked the scientific expertise that would be essential in addressing these issues.

To fill the need, they established the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, and in 1973, seven select scientists and engineers‚Äîthe first class of Fellows‚Äîwere dispatched to congressional offices. Over the next four decades, each new year brought a new and bigger class of Fellows. As the years have passed, alumni have risen to high-impact positions in Congress, the White House, the State Department, federal agencies, research universities, and non-governmental organizations.

Modeled after the U.S. American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science & Technology Policy Fellowship, which has brought science expertise into the U.S. Government for over forty years through the engagement of more than 2600 Fellows, the Fellowship aims to develop a network of scientists within ASEAN who can effectively leverage data to influence and inform policy at national and regional levels. Through its second year, the Fellowship boasts 23 Fellows focusing on a range of regional priority issues. Over the next several years, the Fellowship will continue to place emerging science leaders into government ministries to strengthen evidence-based policy making. 
Currently, the Fellowship is seeking applicants for the 2016/17 cadre focusing on 1) sustainable energy; 2) climate change and variability; and 3) science, technology, and innovation policy. In addition to providing further background on the Fellowship, including achievements of the Fellowship thus far, this video provides pertinent information for host ministries and other regional organizations interested in supporting the Fellowship.",science and technology

HRTVJBwxbJ,What if we could design better technologies through dialogue? [Science and Technology podcast],"While we often talk about the need to achieve acceptance of technology in the face of real and potential public opposition, there are frequently gaps between how regulators, developers and experts conceptualise acceptance and opposition. Here, we examine some prominent conceptualisations and suggest that, rather than responding to public opposition with information campaigns designed to transform citizens into acceptors, strategies for managing public acceptability should include meaningful dialogues that aim to create better technologies which are not only acceptable to citizens, but can even be actively supported by them.

Instead of looking at where potential adversaries are heading, or coming up with the same list of technologies that we‚Äôve come up with to research over the last 20 years, the Air Force Science and Technology strategy will seek to predict where adversaries cannot easily go and ensure that the Air Force gets there first. We will focus on advancing technology solutions along five strategic capabilities. To move the Air Force from a current force challenged by increasingly sophisticated adversaries to a force that dominates time, space and complexity in future conflict.

Global persistent awareness, resilient information sharing, rapid effective decision making, complexity, unpredictability in mass, speed and reach of disruption and lethality ‚Äì those concepts must drive our research as they drive our way to fight. We must think and innovate faster across these capabilities to create multiple dilemmas for our adversaries.‚Äù",science and technology

Video Transcript:

[Shwetak] 
What the MSTI, or the master‚Äôs of science and technology innovation degree, is all about is to really provide a broad understanding of what it means to innovate on a piece of technology. 

This includes the design aspect of it. How do you know that you're building the right thing and how you're building it right? But also prototyping. How do you know that the thing that you're trying to build is even feasible? So appreciating hardware and software development so that you know that this thing can even be built. And then pitching it, and then getting funding for it. So the entrepreneurial side of how do you launch a venture like this. 

And so the program is designed to integrate across all three of these different areas in an offering where a student can do it in one specific degree.

[Linda] 
I think increasingly, in the pace of innovation and development in the technology fields, there's a growing expectation that any one person has a more rounded skillset, that has some of each of those in their skillset. And those are the professionals and the emerging students that are in more demand.

The program is a 15-month program, so you would start in the fall, go the full four quarters and then a fifth quarter which is your launch phase.

[Shwetak] 
So the first 12 months is you'll be iterating on a number of different projects, and you learn the, just the basics through these classes and tutorials.

[Linda] 
Each quarter there's going to be a range of classes from some sort of very specific hands-on studios, something maybe as specific as a hardware-software lab or something about micro-controllers, to a design-thinking studio, which is going to be more processed based.

[Shwetak] 
In the last three months of the 15-month period is what we call the launch phase. So you really settle on a particular project that you want to take it to the next level.

It could be that you're working on a project that's sponsored by a corporation. It can be something where the student comes in and has their own idea, recruits students within the cohort to help them with their project that might get them to a point where they start to maybe spin out a company at the end of the program.

[Linda] 
UW has a fantastic reputation for being the most innovative public university, which is wonderful. There's such a great embracing and support structure here at the University, and in Seattle more broadly, for innovation, for startups.

[Shwetak] 
One of the things that's interesting about this program is not just the top faculty engaging with the students, but it's also the mentors and the, and the technologists and the thought leaders in the Pacific Northwest. This includes members of the venture capital community. It includes engineers and thought leaders at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing.

[Linda] 
So there's a really, a coalescing of that energy, those services, that perspective, that experience in the community here from industry, that GIX will be able to tap into.

[Shwetak] 
So the MSTI is housed within the Global Innovation Exchange.

[Linda] 
GIX, Global Innovation Exchange, is a unique partnership between University of Washington, Tsinghua University and industry partners, most notably Microsoft. It encompasses a new type of interdisciplinary degree program that is much more team- and project-based, hands-on, to develop a closer partnership between industry partners and the educational experience and to really bring together kind of three different domains: technical innovation, an entrepreneurship lens and understanding of the business landscape.

[Shwetak] 
And so we're looking at how do we engage the larger community? Not just the local community, but the global community, to create these really innovative graduate programs that allow students to solve these real-world problems and do it in such a way that's global in spirit.

[Linda] 
So I'm really excited also about the facility that is being developed that will have maker space, and team spaces, studio facilities, you know, be state-of-the-art in terms of technology. It's really going to be a fantastic place for industry, faculty and students to come and work and engage and collaborate.

[Shwetak] 
This program is really designed to teach people how to become innovators.",science and technology

RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,"Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community‚Äôs ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.

Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Äôs (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai‚Äôs research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.

X5fhVLJs9g,William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses,"Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys ‚Äì liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers, they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades, exhibit unique thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.

William L. Johnson, the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech, joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.
Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez, the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's, he, along with Ricardo Schwarz, discovered solid-state amorphization, leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses, pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science, 30, 81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods, B7, 657 (1985)).
This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling, and, in 1993, the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery, characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see, for example, Applied Phys. Letters, 63, 2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.
The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations, including the measurement of thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation, and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.

His research has lead to commercial success, too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies, in Lake Forrest California, which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name ""LiquidMetal Golf""). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry, as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.
Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification, and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics, and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature, and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy, NASA, and corporations. Over the past two decades, he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Engineering.",science and technology

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

4ZtBrF4Ng2I,"Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology - Monday April 30th, 2018","POT TV - Footage from the Canadian Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology.

As the Canadian Senate reaches the deadline for a third vote on Bill C45/46, The Cannabis Act, committee hearings to explore the issue offer a painfully frustrating view into how laws reach royal assent.

Seemingly ignorant of their own report from 2002, which recommended a legal age for cannabis purchase at 16, Senators continue to use the incarceration of peaceful, non-violent citizens for political ends.

Thankfully the day finished with some level-headed opinions, most notably from John Conroy. When asked about the harms of cannabis on youth, Conroy replies simply, 'what is the harm to youth from being arrested?'

Speakers on April 30th, 2018 included:

Michael Bourque, Chief Executive Officer (Canadian Real Estate Association)

Neil Boyd, Professor, Department of Criminology, Simon Fraser University (As an Individual)

John Conroy, Lawyer (As an Individual)

Solomon Friedman, Criminal Defence Lawyer, Edelson & Friedman LLP (As an Individual)

Randall McCauley, Vice-President, Government and Public Relations (Canadian Real Estate Association)

Jonathan Page, Chief Executive Officer (Anandia Labs)

Sean Robichaud, Criminal Defence Lawyer, Robichaud's Barristers & Solicitors (As an Individual)

Deputy Chief Constable Mike Serr, Co-Chair, Drug Advisory Committee (Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police)

Ernest Small, Principal Research Scientist, Science and Technology Branch (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada)

Inspector Bill Spearn (Vancouver Police Department)

ZX8kJfWzvX4,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),"Located in the science and research hub of Daedeok Innopolis in Daejeon, South Korea, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed into an active institution, often placed among some leading universities in global scientific education and research.

KAIST has connotations of academic excellence, innovation and entrepreneurship, but also the launch of large-scale projects. The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.

KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science, with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering, but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.

Its structure was created by an international team, which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea, KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure, which gives the university a special status.

Today, KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, humanities and social sciences, business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools, with over 33 divisions. KAIST‚Äôs unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center, which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.

KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea‚Äôs capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories, 4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events, the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.

Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi, mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.

lATa1bdU3E,President Obama Stresses Importance of Science and Technology to the Nation's Future,"On April 29, 2013 -  President Barack Obama reiterated his strong support for science and technology in this speech to members of the National Academy of Sciences at its 150th annual meeting. Science, technology, engineering, and medicine are critical to the nation's prosperity, Obama said, noting that investments made today are bound to pay off for many years to come. 

The president warned that recent mandatory cuts in federal spending could slow these critical advances in research.  ""With the pace of technological innovation today, we can't afford to stand still for a year or two years or three years,"" Obama said. ""We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead, and we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future."" 

Just as science and technology have advanced the nation in the past, he noted, they will be critical in addressing today's challenges. ""We will continue to pursue advances in science, engineering, infrastructure, education, and environmental protection, and especially science-based innovations to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change,"" Obama said.

President Obama made an impassioned plea to ensure that the nation's young people continue to maintain their spirit of discovery and receive strong educations in STEM.  ""We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates,"" Obama said. ""We want them to be producers as well.  We've got to make sure we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers."" 

Since Abraham Lincoln signed the congressional charter founding the National Academy of Sciences 150 years ago, the Academy has played a critical role in advancing science and shaping public policy. ""[Lincoln] recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the nation,"" Obama said, noting that his administration turns to the Academy for advice on many issues.

""Like President Lincoln 150 years ago, President Obama clearly understands the importance of S&T to the future prosperity and security of our nation,"" said NAS President Ralph J. Cicerone in introductory remarks. ""We're pleased that President Obama and the administration continue to turn to the National Academy of Sciences for help, analysis, and advice on many issues facing the nation and the world today.""

President Obama is the only president to address the National Academy of Sciences' annual gatherings of members twice; he also spoke at the 2009 NAS annual meeting. Other presidents who have addressed the NAS include George H.W. Bush in 1990, John F. Kennedy, who spoke at the NAS Centennial Convocation in 1963 and at the NAS annual meeting in 1961, Jimmy Carter in 1979, and Calvin Coolidge in 1924.

The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and -- with the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council -- provides science, technology, and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.",science and technology

Shocking Secrets Of The Ancient Vedic Science Revealed!

The Vedic civilization, according to the ancient scriptures, was at a much higher level of development than our modern society.

In Sanskrit ‚Äúveda‚Äù means knowledge. So what kind of knowledge are we talking about?

From the standpoint of current evolutionary theory, the human race is supposed to be at the top of the society development. However, according to the Vedic literature, in a distant past there have been civilizations in the world, the greatness of which we cannot even imagine.

A detailed study of the Vedic texts was held in Bombay in 1975.

It was a scientific ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù in physicist circles when the scientists have discovered the vivid description of subatomic level in the Vedas written some five thousand years ago.

The Mahabharata, an ancient historical epic, describes the use of nuclear weapons as follows:

‚ÄúIt was as if all the nature‚Äôs forces have been suddenly unleashed. Something dazzling like the sun revolved in circles. Burned with a heat of this weapon, the world was staggering, as in a fever.

Elephants caught fire from the heat and rushed wildly hither and thither in search of protection from the terrible power. Water in the sea turned hot, the animals were dying, the foes were killed and trees were falling in rows under the fury of the forest fire. Elephants blew their trunks fiercely and fell dead on the ground. Horses and chariots were burned on the spot.

Thus, thousands of enemy chariots were destroyed, and then deep silence descended on the sea. Wind began to blow and the earth shined. It was a terrible sight. The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by terrible heat so that they no longer resembled people. Never before have we seen such a terrible weapon and did not hear about it. ‚Äù (Drona-parva)

The Vedic texts contain a large number of descriptions of different types of weapons, ranging from primitive stone throwing slings (sarvatobhadra), wall smashing mechanisms (udghatima), to all sorts of high velocity dart throwing devices (yantra-sara), and ending with weapons which damaging force does not have modern analogues.

The tenth canto of Bhagavata Purana describes the various battles with weapons of extraordinary power. Those battles were fought by our ancient ancestors inhabited the planet, as well as representatives from other worlds.

It is obvious that our ancestors were much more highly developed than we are today. Comparing to them we look like babies, at least in technical terms.

It appeared that the city was well-protected even in terms of today‚Äôs scientific advancement.

In Vedic literature there are many references to flying saucers. In general, they are called the vimana. Vimanas in the Vedas are divided into two categories:

1) the mechanical machines, similar to airplanes and flying with wings like a bird;

2) and very complex machines that can not be precisely classified, which had unlimited possibilities.

Machines of the first category are described mainly in medieval writings in Sanskrit, along with other various automatic devices and military machines.

There were robots designed in the form of male and female figures that performed various functions. They were made mostly of wood, but perfectly covered with humanlike skin. Their motions were provided by the system of bolts, iron rods, springs and grooves. These figures played musical instruments, served drinks to guests and did other similar services.

Yantrapurusha or man-machine could behave exactly like a real human. It is described in Bhagaya-vastu how an artist visited home of the yantracharya, or a teacher of mechanical engineering. There he was met by a robot-girl who washed his feet and had a resemblance of a real person until he realized that she was unable to speak. However, it is known that there were even speaking and absolutely fantastic sounding robots.
Are we able now, with all our modern science and computer technology, to repeat a similar level of inventive skill? Can we believe that the technical progress, as it is described in the Vedas, has really existed on Earth? Are Sanskrit texts the only proof of greatness of that ancient civilization?",science and technology

PPVY1BPYY2,Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology),"This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. ()

I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")

There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.

The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.

At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.

There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).

What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.

Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)

What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms. I hope the university wisens up and treats us postdocs the way we deserve to be treated.",science and technology

LHtseplPqO4,Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,"Hugh LeCaine of Ottawa created the Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer in his home studio over a period of three years from 1945 to 1948. This synthesizer is the first voltage-controlled synthesizer ever built, preceding the manufacture of commercial synthesizers by twenty years. Le Caine, a nuclear physicist with the National Research Council, was passionate about music. He was concerned that the musical notes produced by electronic instruments in the 1930s, such as the Hammond Organ and the Morse Robb Wave Organs, lacked a certain expressivity. Determined to shape technology for the needs of the musician and expand the possibilities of musical sound he built a synthesizer that allows for complex variations in pitch and tone. This, LeCaine achieved, through the innovative use of voltage control. The technique provides an automatic background voltage that can remain stable or be altered through the manipulation of the knobs and keyboard. The keys are sensitive to a vertical pressure that controls the volume and a lateral pressure that changes the pitch. In this way the musician can simultaneously manipulate the volume, pitch, and timbre of each note and produce gradual transitions from one sound to the next. The rudimentary appearance of the synthesizer  its three legs made of crossed pieces of scrap wood and with instructions penciled onto its surface  camouflages the brilliant concept behind this invention. LeCaine's Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer is the precursor of today's electronic instruments.",science and technology

05EYl-v1_L,SHANGHAI FAKE MARKETS - SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY - CHINA ARIL 2017,"Shanghai Fake Markets @ Science and Technology on Subway Line 2.
Inside of the metro stop is where the fake markets are located. They're are tons of stores, its easy to forget where you started and if you had been where you are already. Most stores will tell you a very ridiculous price at first you just have to tell them to make it what you would like to pay and maybe walk away and they will defiantly being it down. If you know any Chinese speak in Chinese and they won't tell you a crazy price because they think that you might live in china and you know better. They are a lot of stores with the same stuff, so before you buy something check it out in multiple stores so you know your getting the best one and the best price. They have some really cool stuff here, especially if you take your time a look through all the little stores you'll find some really cool stuff not just fake clothes or shoes. THANKS FOR WATCHING 


WATCH THIS: 





Tips 


1. Walk away if they won't bring down price and they will bring it lower immediately.

2. Tell them you'll look in another store, they will also bring it down immediately.

3. Don't let them tell you anything is real, it's all fake.

4. Look in multiple stores before you pick something they're are hundreds of stores selling the same things.

gX3JtwboE,Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,"The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive, one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays), was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima, Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2,768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives, one constructed in 1923, and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co., Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm, British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the ""strong man of the woods"" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings, making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left, positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus, all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22,580 pounds (10, 242 Kg), allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks, extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design, the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive.",science and technology

JkBh71zZKrM,Photons to Bits and Beyond: The Science & Technology of Digital,"The Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science presents the 2011 Victor M. Tyler Distinguished Lectureship in Engineering with Eric Fossum, Professor of Engineering in Dartmouth's Thayer School and a consultant to Samsung Electronics' Semiconductor R&D Center. Dr. Fossum, who earned a PhD in electrical engineering from Yale in 1984, is one of the world's leading solid-state image sensor device physicists, best known for inventing the CMOS image sensor. His ""camera-on-a-chip"" technology is used in nearly all camera phones and webcams, digital-still cameras, high-speed motion capture cameras, automotive cameras, dental x-ray cameras, and swallowable pill cameras.

An entrepreneur as well as inventor, Fossum's transfer of his own IP portfolio to industry has yielded one of Caltech's greatest licensing revenue streams, and he has served as CEO of two successful high-tech companies. His work was included on Reuters' list of ""Baby Boomer Inventions that Changed the World,"" and Forbes calls him an inventor who has ""changed your life.""",science and technology

YsUgHpIlLe4,Investing in Innovation for the Future: Science and Technology 3/21/2013 - Robert D. Atkinson,"Blame for the Great Recession and America's halting recovery has been attributed to many factors. But according to a new book, a major culprit has gone unnamed: the United States' decline in the race for global innovation advantage. A complacent and politically polarized America is fated for a slow, painful transition into a ""Rust Nation,"" they warn, unless our leaders can muster the will to act.

Speaker:
Dr. Robert D. Atkinson is the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, DC-based technology policy think tank. He is also author of the book Innovation Economics: The Race for Global Advantage (Yale, 2012), the book, The Past And Future Of America's Economy: Long Waves Of Innovation That Power Cycles Of Growth (Edward Elgar, 2005), and the State New Economy Index series. He has an extensive background in technology policy, he has conducted ground-breaking research projects on technology and innovation, is a valued adviser to state and national policy makers, and a popular speaker on innovation policy nationally and internationally.

It is named after the charismatic political leader Mawlana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. The medium of instruction is English. Every year, almost 800 (currently 795) students are enrolled in undergraduate programs to study in this institution. The number of teachers is about 169. The University has continued to expand over the last few years. This includes the construction of new academic buildings, library building, teachers dorm, Vice chancellor residence, several halls for the students etc. Five halls for both male (Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall, Shahid Ziaur Rahman Hall ,Muktijoddha Abdul Mannan Hall for male and Shahid Janani Jahanara Imam Hall ,Alema Khatun Bhashani Hall for ladies) already completed and more to go. Such popular and successful man Professor Dr. Md. Alauddin is on charge for vice chancellorship again for 4 years (2017-2021) after his first tenure (2013-2017).


The Prime Minister of The Peoples Republic of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina founded the foundation-stone of MBSTU at Sontosh, Tangail in 1999. Md. Yousuf Sharif Ahmed Khan was appointed as its first vice-chancellor on 21 November 2002. Classes began 25 October 2003 with 5 teachers and 83 students.[1] Initially the university had two departments, Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The following year two more departments were added, Criminology and Police Science (CPS) and Environmental Science and Resource Management (ESRM).[2]

In the 2005-2006 academic session, three more departments were opened: Textile Engineering (TE), Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering (BGE), and Food Technology & Nutritional Science (FTNS).[3][4][5] In the 2010-2011 academic session, four more departments were added: Business Administration,[citation needed] Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, and Physics. In 2012, Mathematics and Statistics split into two departments.[6][7][8] .In the 2014-2015 academic session, two more departments were added named Pharmacy and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology ,founded by VC .

Between 2013 and 2015, MBSTU was the scene of several violent clashes allegedly involving the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). University staff were beaten, payments were extorted, buildings were vandalized, classrooms were set on fire, and in May 2015 a student was killed, which caused Vice Chancellor Mohammad Alauddin to temporarily close the university

The university campus is located at Tangail , a city about 75 kilometres (47 mi) north-west of the capital, Dhaka. MBSTU campus is situated at Santosh, which is in the southwestern part of Tangail. It has a modest-size campus with limited capacity for residence within walking distances of the academic buildings. The campus occupies about 57 acres (0.23 km2) and a budget of approximately 3.66 billion BDT has been approved for the enlargement of the university .[citation needed][12] This area accommodates five faculties, the administrative building, the central library, cafeteria, VC house, five student halls, teachers dorm, medical centre, sports field, monuments etc. The historic Darbar Hall (auditorium), built under the direct supervision of Mawlana Bhashani himself, a dighi (big pond) named after the mystic guru, Pir (saint/wali) Shah Zamaan, the Mazaar (Shrine) of Mawlana Bhashani, a mosque and several other institutions are also present within the university premises. Bijoy angon and Memorial for the memory of martyr intellectual 1971 is also the favorite place for students.

Besides these, the university also owns some land in Hrathkhola, Santosh, where the residence facility for the teachers' has been proposed to be constructe

X_ESxckVR7M,"Master of Technology Management: Engineering, Science and Entrepreneurship","For more information: http://www.mtm.ucsb.edu

The best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphase
as well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.
We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allow
you to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars and
teachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",science and technology

The task force was established under the White House National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology to examine the potential of technology to maximize independence for older Americans by sustaining health, independence and opportunities for social engagement. In early March, this task force released a report that identified a range of emerging technologies that have significant potential to assist older adults. The report identified six primary functional capabilities as being critical to individuals who wish to maintain their independence as they age and for which technology may have a positive impact: key activities of independent living, cognition, communication and social connectivity, personal mobility, transportation, and access to healthcare.

Aage ke sapne saja rakhe the naajane kab se.
Bade utavle the yahaan se jaane KO,
Zindagi ka agla padaav paane KO.

Par naa jane kyon ..Dil mein aaj kuch aur aata hai,
Waqt ko rokne ka jee chahta hai.

Jin baton ko lekar rote the Aaj un par hansi aati hai,
Na jaane kyon aaj un palon ki yaad bahut aati hai .

Kaha karte the ..Badi mushkil se char saal seh gaya,
Par aaj kyon lagta hai ki kuch peeche reh gaya.

Na bhoolne wali kuch yaadein reh gayi,
Yaadein jo ab jeene ka sahara ban gayi.

Meri taang ab kaun kheencha karega ,
Sirf mera sir khane kaun mera peecha karega.
Jahaan 2000 ka hisaab nahin wahaan 2 rupay ke liye
kaun ladega,

Kaun raat bhar saath jag kar padega ,
Kaun mere naye naye naam banayega.
Mein ab bina matlab kis se ladoonga,
Bina topic ke kisse faalto baat karoonga ,

Kaun fail hone par dilasa dilayega,
Kaun galti se number aane par gaaliyaan sunayega .

Dhabe par Chaay kis ke saath piyoonga ,
Wo haseen pal ab kis ke saath jiyoonga,

Aise dost kahaan milenge Jo khai mein bhi dhakka de aayein,
Par fir tumhein bachane khud bhi kood jayein.

Mere gaano se pareshaan kaun hoga ,
Kabhi muje kisi ladki se baat karte dekh hairaan kaun hoga ,

Kaun kahega saale tere joke pe hansi nahin aai ,
Kaun peeche se bula ke kahega..aage dekh bhai .

Achanak bin matlab ke kisi ko bhi dekh kar paglon ki
tarah hansna,
Na jaane ye fir kab hoga .

Doston ke liye professor se kab lad payenge ,
Kya hum ye fir kar payenge,

Kaun muje mere kabiliyat par bharosa dilayega,
Aur jyada hawa mein udne par zameen pe layege ,

Meri khushi mein sach mein khush kaun hoga ,

Floating cities: the future or a washed-up idea?

""In my view, the future of ocean cities is in technology campuses and in tourism. Given the significant risk of a community in extreme isolation in international waters, the solution to bringing people together in mid-ocean requires us to think about what connects us: technology, work and play. In these three elements we see, perhaps, the two lowest-hanging fruits (or the most buoyant of possibilities) for ocean cities.""

OCEANIX and BIG unveil a floating city of the future at the United Nations
 
""Land reclamation (creating new land by pouring sand in the ocean) is no longer seen as sustainable, as it uses precious sand resources and causes coastal areas to lose protective wetlands and mangroves. Could floating cities be the way forward for expanding our cities as we deal with the consequences of climate change and sea-level rise?""

The Oceanix City project design was a collaboration between Oceanix, Bjarke Ingels Group, MIT Center for Ocean Engineering, Mobility in Chain, Sherwood Design Engineers, Center for Zero Waste Design, Transsolar KlimaEngineering, Global Coral Reef Alliance, Studio Other Spaces, and Dickson Despommier.

SzJ46YA_RaA,Map of Computer Science,"The field of computer science summarised. Learn more at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos

Computer science is the subject that studies what computers can do and investigates the best ways you can solve the problems of the world with them. It is a huge field overlapping pure mathematics, engineering and many other scientific disciplines. In this video I summarise as much of the subject as I can and show how the areas are related to each other.

A couple of notes on this video:
1. Some people have commented that I should have included computer security alongside hacking, and I completely agree, that was an oversight on my part. Apologies to all the computer security professionals, and thanks for all the hard work!
2. I also failed to mention interpreters alongside compilers in the complier section. Again, I‚Äôm kicking myself because of course this is an important concept for people to hear about. Also the layers of languages being compiled to other languages is overly convoluted, in practice it is more simple than this. I guess I should have picked one simple example.
3. NP-complete problems are possible to solve, they just become very difficult to solve very quickly as they get bigger. When I said NP-complete and then ""impossible to solve"", I meant that the large NP-complete problems that industry is interested in solving were thought to be practically impossible to solve.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In this food tour, Mina and I discovered authentic North Korean food in Seoul. Seoul is only 50 km from North Korea, and home to many North Koreans, some of whom have opened restaurants in the city. I‚Äôve been to Seoul many times, but never had any like these unique North Korean dishes before. Naengmyeon is known to be one of the most common North Korean foods, but we wanted to try a few other lesser known North Korean dishes as well.

Here are the North Korean restaurants we ate at on this food tour:

Dongmu Bapsang (ÎèôÎ¨¥Î∞•ÏÉÅ) - This is where you can order the giant platter of rainbow noodles, and I would strongly recommend it. They pour the soup tableside, and it‚Äôs such a refreshing dish. Additionally the Sundae, Korean blood sausage, was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Total price - 61,000 KRW ($51.63)

Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) - Situated just off the main road in an unassuming small house like building Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) specializes mostly in North Korean bowls of noodles and mandu dumplings. The food was very good, tasted handmade, and the restaurant feels very homely. The owner really warmed up to us, and as we left, even insisted that we take umbrellas. Total price - 44,000 KRW ($34.70)

Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) - Finally, the third restaurant on this North Korean food tour of Seoul, we went to Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) to eat Naengmyeon noodles, and this massive pan of beef hot pot with herbs. Total price - 104,000 KRW ($88.03) 

Overall, North Korean food seems very pure, some things with less flavor, a little more plain, yet still flavorful and focusing on the natural ingredients without extras. Taking this North Korean food tour of Seoul was a fun experience, especially hanging out and eating with Mina.

Village food in Pakistan is AMAZING! Today, we're going DEEP into the countryside of Pakistan to try local village cooking, trying a DELICIOUS Chicken curry made by grandma, and a huge Pakistani village LUNCH!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) taking you for a RARE VILLAGE FOOD feast with my friends Saim and Ali! We drove out to Saim's hometown village in the countryside of Pakistan for some extremely delicious home cooking village style! 

‚ñ∫3 Months FREE on ExpressVPN and 49% OFF! 

Village food in Pakistan is very delicious, perhaps even more delicious than street food in Pakistan! One of the most unique foods in this food video in Pakistan we tried was the saag spinach and mustard curry combined with the COW DUNG FUEL tandoor oven that cooked the paratha in!

In this village cooking video, Granny is cooking up a ton of local specialties, and we are going for a village tour to see how the locals live! We ride a buffalo, visit the cow dung drying area, and taste some of the local well water!

When we arrived in Saim's family village, one of the things that really struck me is how happy everyone is. The local way of life is very relaxing and calming! We were invited to his home and watched Saim's granny cooking up all of her village secrets! The Pakistani village recipes were amazing to taste! This was the trip of a lifetime!

We watched Saim's granny preparing paratha and also some corn flour paratha, SUPER TASTY chicken curry prepared by granny, and also some amazing desserts too! Watching it all was breathtaking!

Thanks so much for watching!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

There is much more street food in our Pakistani food videos series, get ready for the playlist of a lifetime!!

87If-Q2pJWQ,Philippines Street Food - AMAZING Filipino Food at Aling Sosing's Carinderia in Manila!,"One of the best Filipino food meals you can eat in Manila!
‚ñ∫Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you‚Äôre a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you‚Äôll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you‚Äôre eating, and it‚Äôs fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don‚Äôt cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I‚Äôve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it‚Äôs every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you‚Äôre looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you‚Äôre going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

RUFI3_IUDC,KING of ƒ∞SKENDER KEBAB - 150 Year Old TURKISH Street Food in Bursa!! BEST Street Food in Turkey 2019,"Ottoman Street Food in Bursa, Turkey! (BUTTER ALERT!!!)

Izmir Street Food : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im2gV...

Welcome to the SECOND episode of our TURKISH STREET FOOD series! This time we‚Äôre in BURSA - home of the Iskender Kebap, mountains and tons of delicious street food! 

We are starting our food tour with a Turkish breakfast special - simit and tahini pide. Simit is a circular, dense bread covered in sesame seeds. Almost like a Turkish bagel. Tahini pide is a doughy pastry smothered in thick tahini sauce (made of sesame paste). We washed it down with √ßay (Turkish tea) and ate a cheesy pastry which was a free sample! (Simit: 1.50 TRY/0.17 USD)  (Pide 3 TRY/ 0.51 USD) 

Next, we wondered around the MASSIVE market area known as Balƒ±k√ßƒ±lar Pazarƒ±. This fish/fresh market has everything you could ever want! We sampled olives, honey mulberry, cherries and watched artichoke cutting! 

Inside the Balƒ±k√ßƒ±lar Pazarƒ±, we visit a local shop serving up fresh cantik. It is made with beef, tomatoes, onions and baked similar to pide. We also tried the Turkish drink called Ayran, which is a salty yogurt. It is a drink you have to try in Turkey. (8 TRY/ 1.36 USD each)

Next stop: The ancient Koza Han, which is a historical silk market from 1491 that used to sell silkworm cocoons and textiles. Nearby is the Grand Mosque of Bursa. It boasts 20 domes and 2 minarets and is a beautiful sight in the centre of Bursa. 

A visit to Bursa is not complete until you have tried ISKENDER KEBAP, which is Bursa‚Äôs claim to fame! We visit the restaurant where Iskender Kebab was BORN! Juicy, tender meat covered in sheep‚Äôs butter served with tomato and yogurt on top of flat bread. Every bite is HEAVEN!!! (39 TRY/6.64 USD for 1 portion)

We watched the gorgeous sunset at an iconic Bursa sight - Tophane Clock Tower, and finished our street food tour in the park for √ßay! We hope you enjoyed, thank you so much for watching! More videos from Turkey coming very soon. Next up - Istanbul, so make sure to subscribe so you don‚Äôt miss the next street food tour!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) and my friends Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing you in FULL ON for a huge IFTAR Pakistani Street food in Karachi tour for RAMZAN also known as Ramadan!!  We're trying EXTREME Chicken Chargha cooked right on the street using local Pakistani recipes and spices and we are also going exploring down burns road in Karachi for lots more delicious street food!

‚ñ∫Huge thanks to Alizeh too: 

In this IFTAR Street Food tour of Karachi, Pakistan,We're going street food rangin' for tons of famous Pakistani Street Food in Karachi, mostly all the BEST and most famous Iftar Street food in Karachi, like samosas, gulab jamon, jalebi, extreme street chicken, and also some insanely delicious Pulao!! At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge! There were HUGE pots of biryani and pulao and everyone was waiting patiently for the food. We helped serve the biryani and pulao and then had a taste for ourselves! It was one of the BEST pulao rice I've ever tasted!

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.

SALVADOR, BAHIA - Before ever going to Brazil, Salvador was one of the top cities I wanted to visit - and finally this is the time. In this all out ultimate street food tour of Salvador we‚Äôll focus especially on Afro-Brazilian food and culture, the heart of Salvador, Bahia. The people were amazing, the food was delicious.     

Sao Joaquim Market - To begin this street food tour we started in the morning at Sao Joaquim Market, one of the main fruits and vegetables market, with restaurant and food as well. One thing you‚Äôll see all over the market, different from other parts of Brazil is dend√™ oil, the orange palm oil originally from West Africa.

Recanto Da Lucia - At the market we ate breakfast at Recanto Da Lucia, a small local Brazilian food stall serving amazing dishes like feijoada and pir√£o. Total price - 80 BRL ($20.61)

Dona Susana - Next up on this Afro-Brazilian food tour of Salvador, we drover to Dona Susana, a restaurant under the highway, with a million dollar view. The main dish to eat in Bahia is Moqueca Bahiana, a stew of fish or seafood in palm oil and coconut milk. Her‚Äôs was outstanding as was the ensopado de camar√£o and her version of pir√£o. One of the most stunning locations so far in Brazil. Total price - 87 BRL ($22.41)

Pelourinho - This is the center of the historic city of Salvador, with a distinct Portuguese style and influence. If you look around, you might think you‚Äôre in Portugal.

Capoeira - Pelourinho is a center of art and culture and I had a chance to learn about Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art, but a dance at the same time. It‚Äôs amazing to watch and they even volunteered me to stand as they came dangerously close to kicking me!

Elevador Lacerda - In Pelourinho you‚Äôll also find the Elevador Lacerda, which takes you from lover Salvador to the upper part of Salvador.
Price - .15 BRL ($0.03) per person

Mercado Modelo - One of the main central old city markets in Salvador, Bahia is Mercado Modelo, and while most of the market is pretty touristy, Jacibar on the outside serves up delicious local dishes. We ordered Xinxin de Galinha, Bob√≥ de camar√£o, and Caruru. It was an incredible meal. Total price - 180 BRL ($46.37)

Tambores e Cores - Samba beats represent Salvador, Bahia, and the thundering drums are a must see when you‚Äôre in Bahia, Brazil.

Boteco Di Janela - In the evening we went to Boteco Di Janela, a bar and restaurant, friendly owners, and delicious seafood. We ate sarapatel - a blood stew, and sururu - small local mussels.

Acaraj√© da Ivone - If there‚Äôs one Brazilian street food snack you have to eat in Salvadar, it‚Äôs Acaraj√©, a life-changing bun of blackeyed peas deep fried in palm oil and stuffed with vatapa, caruru, shrimp, and salad. It‚Äôs is unbelievable and the owners at Acaraj√© da Ivone were equally as friendly and hospitable. I also had an Abara, the same thing except the black eyed pea fritter is steamed instead of fried. Price - 8 BRL ($2.06) per

Salvador, Bahia, in Brazil, exceeded my expectations - the food and people were outstanding and made it a city and destination I will never forget. What a stunning combination of natural beauty, food, and hospitality.

If you love to indulge in regional cuisines then this episode might come handy in engaging you with the culinary collage of one of the most popular South Indian cuisines, the Telugu cuisine that is known for its spicy and tangy flavours. It is native to the Telugu speaking population from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and has three distinct categories-the coastal Andhra cuisine, the Rayalaseema cuisine and the Telangana cuisine- that have been shaped by the varied topographical influences.

In case of cereals, rice is a staple of the irrigated Andhra region and also Rayalseema too. Ragi is very popular in Rayalseema. In the semi arid Telengana, millet-based breads (roti) are predominant. The cooking techniques are also diverse in all the three regions. Across all zones we noticed a liberal use of spices in the food. 
Meat and seafood (coastal areas) feature prominently on the menus while dal (lentils)is also a common dish in the veg section. Tomatoes, coconut, chilies and tamarind are generously used in curries. Spicy and hot pickles and chutneys are common accompaniments in the Telugu cuisine.
So let‚Äôs get started with this enlightening gastronomic exploration with our amazing  host Sankalp Vishnu  as we brace ourselves to savour and discuss some of the popular traditional delicacies of the Telugu cuisine. We visited three celebrated restaurant that have earned the fame for serving the best and authentic versions of these respective cuisines in Hyderabad.

For Andhra cuisine we went to The Spicy Venue at Jubilee hills. Here we met  the owner Sampath who introduced us to this cuisine and over the due course of the meal, shared many insightful details about it. The spread here was extensive, spicy and tangy but super delicious. We started with pain plain Rice and ghee which was the staple and then moved onto the popular traditional veg and non veg dishes. The feast ended with the most delectable apricot dessert  that we had ever tasted. 

Our next destination was Rayalseema Ruchulu where we tried some of the traditional Rayalseema delicacies. The curries were quite similar in flavour to the Andhra ones though there was a notable difference in the spice quotient and the sourness aspect of the two cuisines. All the curries and chutneys were mostly paired with either Ragi Sangati or Jonne Rotte. The bottle gourd halwa is the popular dessert from this region. The food here was equally scrumptious.

Finally Sankalp took us to Mercure hotel on the eve of Telangana Foundation day to try the authentic Telangana spread that was being showcased there on this special occasion. The chef in charge introduced us to the popular dishes from the region. We then had a hearty meal along with the palm wine, a traditional alcoholic drink native to this region. The sweet dishes included the arise and rava ladoo.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our hosts including our gastronomic partner Sankalp bhai. This cultural connection through the regional culinary traditions wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their hospitality, support and cooperation.

If you have one day to eat, this German food tour of Munich will give you some serious satisfaction. I have to admit, I going to multiple back to back restaurants to eat German food is a challenge - German food is so hearty and so filling. By the end of this food tour in Munich, I was ready to sleep immediately!

Here are all the details about the restaurants and prices of the dishes I ate:

1. Andy's Krablergarten
Andy's Krablergarten is known for their schnitzel, and they serve it up in a huge way. The cutlets are made from pork, and they are big and fried fresh. I tried a Hamburg schnitzel with eggs and a Munich style schnitzel with horseradish in the breading. It was fantastic. 
Address: Thalkirchner Str. 2, 80337 M√ºnchen, Germany
Price: 10.90 EUR per schnitzel

2. Andechser am Dom
This is a nice German food restaurant, located on the side of Munich Frauenkirche, a  major landmark in the heart of Munich. They serve a variety of traditional German Bavarian cuisine. My favorite dish was the mixed sausage plate, but the leberk√§se was also good.
Address: Weinstra√üe 7A, 80333 M√ºnchen, Germany
Total price: 36.30 EUR

3. Ice cream at Schuhbeck's Eissalon
Address: Pfisterstra√üe 11, 80331 M√ºnchen, Germany

4. Bergwolf
Bergwolf is a German fast food restaurant in Munich, and their speciality is currywurst, a plate of sausage topped in sauce and fries. It‚Äôs not the healthiest of all German dishes, but it sure tastes pretty amazing - one of those 3 am kind of dishes.
Address: Fraunhoferstra√üe 17, 80469 M√ºnchen, Germany
Price: 5.40 EUR

5. Augustiner Br√§ustuben
Augustiner Br√§ustuben is a classic German brewery and restaurant in Munich, Germany. You‚Äôll find some very classic Bavarian dishes on their menu and a good selection of beer.
Address: Landsberger Str. 19, 80339 M√ºnchen, Germany

Hawaii is always a special place to eat for me, because it‚Äôs one of the places where I grew to love eating so much. When I was a kid, I would come every now and then to visit relatives in Hawaii and feast upon local Hawaii, Hawaiian food, and a variety of Asian food as well. In this video, we‚Äôre going on an ultimate single day local Hawaii food tour.

Joe‚Äôs Grill Express - Located not to far from the Honolulu airport, Joe‚Äôs Grill Express is an awesome local spot for Hawaii style breakfast. I went with the special loco moco, including hamburger patty, spam, and eggs, all over rice, with mac salad.
Total price - $7.08

Alicia‚Äôs Market - One of my all time favorite places to eat in Honolulu is Alicia‚Äôs Market. They serve a combination of Hawaiian food and local eats, and plenty of different types of poke. I had some roasted meat and the Hawaiian food plate.
Price - $11.47 (But the owner gave me a bunch of free meat, thank you Chris)

Tamashiro Market - Another long standing icon when it comes to Honolulu food is Tamashiro market, a small seafood market. They have all sorts of fresh seafood you can buy, and they also have a good variety of different poke and prepared seafood.
Total price - $29.59

Waiola Shave Ice - I‚Äôve been going to Waiola shave ice since I was a kid and I still think it‚Äôs the best in Hawaii because of its incredible fine soft ice. 
Price - $3.75

Itchy Butt - Finally to finish off this Hawaii food tour of Honolulu, we went to a relatively new place, my first time. Some relatives of mine had told me about it, and also every time I drove past, I would see a hungry crowd standing outside at all times. Plus I couldn't wait to try it due to its name. It was pretty good, although Korean fried chicken tends to be a little sweet for me.
Total price - $24.00

And that completes this Honolulu food tour, hope you enjoyed it and hope this gives you some ideas about what kind of local food to eat when you visit Honolulu, Hawaii!

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

BEL√âM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It‚Äôs all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cacha√ßa - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cacha√ßa, Brazil‚Äôs sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it‚Äôs serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There‚Äôs nothing like Amazon fruits and here‚Äôs the juices we tried: Cupua√ßu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here‚Äôs where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Bel√©m!

Tacac√° Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacac√°, I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is, and how it‚Äôs not loved all over the world! We also had Vatap√°. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Ros√°rio Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Ros√°rio Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Bel√©m, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

Im2gVWc2-hU,TURKISH STREET FOOD : You've NEVER Seen this Before!!! KEBAB HEAVEN + Street Food in Izmir Turkey,"Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar Street Food tour in IZMIR, TURKEY

Welcome to the first episode of our Turkey street food series. historical KEMERALTI BAZAAR (Tarihi Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±)!

We start our street food tour at a famous ‚Äúb√∂rek√ßisi‚Äù for some savoury b√∂rek pastries. We ordered our b√∂rek with pastirma and cheese. It was very delicious and fun to watch the chef prepare the dish! (17 TRY / 2.92 USD)

Continuing through the ancient 7th century market, we find an extremely unique shop serving up an Izmir speciality Tur≈°u Suyu, which is pickle juice! Made up of simple ingredients to be sour, spicy and extremely refreshing. Pickle juice is best enjoyed in Izmir in the summer heat! (3 TRY / 0.52 USD)

For lunch, we try manisa kebap, hailing from the city of Manisa which is right outside of Izmir. The dish consists of kebab chunks, served on top of flatbread with a side of tomato sauce and yogurt. It is also covered in rich butter. So mouthwatering and very CHEAP! (32 TRY / 5.50 USD with unlimited tea)

Just outside of the market is the Izmir Clock Tower. It is considered the symbol of Izmir and shouldn‚Äôt be missed while you‚Äôre in the city. It is a great place to take in the views of the sea. 

We were craving something sweet and went back into the market for shambli, a semolina cake soaked in syrup, mixed with walnuts, filled with cream, and some are covered in crushed pistachio. This will give you a sugar HIGH! (regular 5 TRY / 0.86 USD + pistachio 6 TRY / 1.03 USD)

To wash it all down, Turkish coffee is like no other coffee in the world and many shops have their own unique way of making it. Turkish coffee is always unfiltered so expect it to be strong and full of silt. (7 TRY / 1.20 USD)

We made a quick stop for ‚Äúmacun‚Äù which is an Ottoman candy. It is made in the most traditional way and these vendors do not have 1 location.  (4 TRY / 0.69 USD)

For our final stop of the day, we had to eat some seafood because Izmir is quite famous for it‚Äôs fresh fish! We chose a midye dolma (translation: STUFFED MUSSELS) restaurant. These mussels are stuffed with spiced rice and locals squeeze lemon directly onto each and every mussel.These were the FRESHEST mussels we‚Äôve tried in all of Turkey! (14 TRY / 2.41 USD for half kilo)

Does English food deserve its bad reputation? Kids taste some classic UK dishes to find out.

¬ª THE TRADITIONAL FOOD IN MADAGASCAR

1. TSENA‚ÄôNY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup
ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar‚Äôs capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. 
----
2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. 

ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

qsOjuogpKZ,What Are the Top 8 Jewish Foods?,"Judaism has a very close relationship with food. Most holidays have one or more specific foods associated to it. There are many Jews that observe Jewish dietary laws, like keeping kosher and not cooking on Shabbat. 

But what's the history of why some foods are Jewish and some are not? How did Matzo Ball Soup get its name? This video will give you a glimpse into the history of some iconic Jewish foods. 

BONUS: If you live in the Bay Area, we went to several restaurants where you can find these Jewish foods. 

Special thanks to the following restaurants:

Frena Bakery (certified kosher)
132 6th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103

Saul's Restaurant & Delicatessen
1475 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94709

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

Number Eight. Hamantashen. It‚Äôs the best Jewish cookie. (Not that there‚Äôs much competition.) Named for the villain of the Purim story, Haman (BOOOO!!!!), who wore a three cornered hat. You can find chocolate, cherry or apricot but the classic hamantash is always filled with poppy seeds.

Number Seven. Potato Latkes. These are delicious fried potato pancakes that you eat during Chanukah. But let‚Äôs be real here. Latkes can be enjoyed any time. It turns out they're an old Italian Jewish custom from way back in the 14th century. It is told that this is the first time Jews fried pancakes to celebrate Chanukah, only back then they were made of cheese. 

Number Six. Matzo Ball Soup. For many, matzo ball soup is an absolute staple during Passover. Matzo balls were originally called knaidelach, Yiddish for dumpling. As Germans, Austrians, and Alsatian immigrants came to the US in the 30s, the Manischewitz Company released a kosher cookbook describing the now-famous matzo balls as ""feathery balls, Alsatian style‚Äù. Historians have said it was likely early 20th-century American comedians that finally called them ""matzo balls."" 

Number Five. Shakshuka. Served in a iron skillet, this is a hot dish of simmered onions, garlic, bell peppers, tomatoes, spices and with a few eggs dropped on top to cook. Dip a bagel or French bread in this classic Israeli breakfast. Shakshuka was brought to Israel by North African Jews, where it‚Äôs a staple thanks to Israel's large North African Jewish communities.

Number Four. Burekas. Every culture has its stuffed pastry. In Israel these are called bourekasim and they‚Äôre puff pastry stuffed with cheese, potatoes, veggies, meat...whatever floats your boat. These are appetizers and Israeli street food... the perfect portable snack.

Number Three. Jelly Donuts. Also known as Sufganiyot, which derives from the Hebrew word for sponge, which perfectly describes the way they absorb oil. Best eaten warm, sufganiyot are often topped with powdered sugar and practically melt in your mouth.

Number Two. Cholent. This is a fan favorite in the observant Jewish world because it‚Äôs all about keeping Shabbat and not using electricity to cook on Saturday. Cholent is stew that you set up on Friday afternoon before welcoming Shabbat. You throw in beans, potatoes, garlic, barley, onions, flanken, maybe eggs, maybe jachnun, and then your family‚Äôs ultra secret spices or sauces all into the pot and let it cook for...entirely too long. Bust into the cholent on Saturday for lunch after twelve plus hours of it smelling amazing.

Number One. Challah Bread. Many might think of Challah as that sweet and tasty french toast they had at brunch last Sunday. But actually this beloved, braided egg bread is eaten at Shabbat dinners around the world. Some believe that the braid represents the idea of unity because on every Shabbat, we dedicate time out of our busy lives to come together to feast and rest before the start  of a new week. 

What‚Äôs your favorite Jewish food? Did we miss one? Let us know in the comments below!

46Fslwmuj,NIGHT MARKET FOOD in Manila Philippines: BBQ & BLOOD STEW,"My last night in Manila Philippines and I really wanted to try out one of the local popular night market for some night time eats. One of my local friends suggested Central Mercado a wonderfully vibrant night market in the heart of Manila.

The night market first of all, smelled incredible. From the roasted meat skewers to the refreshing local drinks, there was something for everyone at this night market.

Having filled up on great eats at this night market, I proceeded to a local restaurant that many locals recommended for a taste of Dinuguan which is essentially pork blood stew with organ meat inside.

Locations:

8Ow-haL7okA,SOFTEST Idli in the WORLD | AWESOME Upma Dosa + MIRCHI Bhajji + PUNUGULU,"‚ñ∫ More Street Food in Hyderabad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3mt...

‚ñ∫ Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoo...

Just like anywhere else in India, the street food scenario in Hyderabad is quite vibrant and varied. The food available on its streets varies from the pan Indian favourites like Pav Bhajis to regional favourites like the Dosas. However an important offshoot of this street side food culture is the tiffin centres that are a ubiquitous phenomenon all over the city .  

These are modest vegetarian eateries that provide simple, affordable, hearty and filling breakfast or post lunch meals to the hungry souls. They generally serve the popular South Indian vegetarian fares like fluffy idlis, golden dosas, spicy vadas, irresistible bhajis or fritters etc. to the discerning masses. Its a boon for those who are either keen enthusiasts of such amazing street side treat or who don‚Äôt have the scope to partake a proper homemade meal.

So in this concluding episode of our Hyderabad Street Food tour, our foodie duo Anubhav Sapra and Sankalp Vishnu bring you a tempting expedition to one of the most popular tiffin centres in the city, the Purna Tiffins.

Sankalp told us that this unassuming tiffin centre serves the most divine idlis and other South Indian tiffin items. And he was absolutely right in his claim. From the very first morsel, we got the cue that our quest to eat at the best tiffin centre has led us to the right place. Here we tried the Punugulu, Stuffed Mirchi Bhajis, Vades, the sensational Babai Idlis and the unique Upma dosa along with the most lip smacking range of chutneys. 

The star of the meal was the Babai idlis which was essentially plain idlis sprinkled with a liberal amount of Karam Podi and splattered with generous amount of ghee. It was fresh, hot, soft, distinctly flavourful and simply divine. Among the chutneys that accompanied all the delicacies, the sweet and sour allum or the ginger chutney was the delicious best. If you can't resist the sight of a South Indian snacks then this place is a must visit. 

We thank our amazing host Sankalp Bhai for treating us to such scrumptious tiffin delicacies in Hyderabad

FGe3KhkNx,"Mouthwatering INDIAN STREET FOOD Breakfast Tour - Puri, Sabji & Raj Kachori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

EoYFFbVKX5E,Disneyland FOOD REVIEW! Best & Worst Foods,"I visited the happiest place on earth Disneyland! Disneyland is known for its attractions and rides, but I didn't go there for that. I went to go on a food adventure to see what best and worst foods they served in Disneyland. After touring the food stalls at the park, I had to get some real dinner because eating the food at the park didn't fill me up as much. So I went to eat some Chinese food at one of my favorite restaurants in San Gabriel.

k4NUlfqqT9I,"Healthy Food and a Proper Diet, How Does One Decide? | Sadhguru","Sadhguru reminds us that food is about the body, and the best way to decide what to eat is to ask the body. He explains that rather than developing eating habits which only make us function repetitively, it is better to decide on our food consciously through our intelligence.

Transcript: 

Questioner: So my question is should we believe in that like the qualities of vegetarianism, non-alcoholism, celibacy, practice them so that we make our body fit. So that that kriya of eleven minutes will be more effective?

Sadhguru: Oh, see, this is what I have been saying right through ‚Äì why even eating is a moral value? Food is about the body. We must eat what is suitable for this body but right now you are talking about making food into a habit. I want to tell you there is no such thing as good habit or bad habit. Habit means you‚Äôre functioning unconsciously. If you are functioning unconsciously that‚Äôs the bad thing because the whole thing about being human is we are capable of doing things consciously. That is the beauty of being human that we can do everything consciously. What an animal does unconsciously we can do the same thing consciously. We can eat unconsciously or we can eat consciously. We can breathe unconsciously or we can breathe consciously.

Everything that we can do, we can do it consciously. The moment we do something consciously suddenly that human being looks very refined and wonderful. Just because somebody walks and speaks consciously, doesn‚Äôt he become a beautiful human being? Yes or no?

Participants: Yes

Sadhguru: That‚Äôs all. So why is it that we are trying to develop habits as if this is a good thing? Habit means fixed realities where you don‚Äôt have to think. You get up in the morning and it‚Äôll happen to you. No, don‚Äôt try to automize your life. That is not efficiency. That is the efficiency of the machine. This one is supposed to function intelligently and consciously. Nobody is expecting it to function like a machine.

So about food and stuff ‚Äì food must be suitable for the body that we eat for ‚Äì it is for the body. This is the building material for this body the food that you‚Äôre eating. What is the appropriate food unfortunately is all messed up right now. Traditionally we ate very sensibly in this country but these thousand years of invasions has brought other kinds of food cultures and today the national diet is pizza or pasta. What is it‚Ä¶which is one, I don‚Äôt know, both are competing. So we are losing our sense about food. It‚Äôs definitely time to look at what is the most suitable thing. If I go into that food, it‚Äôs a very long process but you must experiment with food, not just by the tongue, but by the body. You eat something today and see‚Ä¶just learn to observe how agile and how active your body feels after eating this food. If it feels like it wants to go to the grave that‚Äôs not good food. if it feels like it wants to be alive after eating this ‚Äì except coffee because that‚Äôs a stimulant ‚Äì if you eat food and your body feels very agile and alive that means it‚Äôs good food, body is liking it. If you eat something, it feels dull that means it‚Äôs not liking it. It‚Äôs having difficulty with it that‚Äôs why it feels dull. So just on this basis. There‚Äôs a much, I mean this is the very simplistic way of putting it.

¬ª THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

ü¶ê Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

üí∏PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

üêüTakamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo‚Äôs finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

Meet Caillou, the lovable 4 year old with a big imagination! Caillou experiences all the wonders of being a child that audiences around the world can relate to; first day of school, caring for a pet, learning a new sport or spending time with family.  Preschoolers will feel right at home with trusted pal Caillou, his sister Rosie and all their family and friends as they experience the everyday adventures of childhood. 

Caillou lives in a blue house at 17 Pine Street with his mother, father, and his younger sister, Rosie. He has many adventures with his family and friends and uses his imagination in every episode.

Caillou, nicknamed The Prince of Imagination, is the title character of the show.

Caillou is an average, imaginative, bald four-year-old boy with a love for forms of transportive machinery such as rocket ships and airplanes. A dreamer, Caillou is prone to frequent dream sequences in some episodes, visualizing his daydreams and hopes, and many episodes chronicle his normal daily experiences with his parents, friends, and neighbours. Caillou particularly loves his stuffed dinosaur Rexy and teddy bear Teddy, along with his pet cat Gilbert, all of whom are depicted as puppets in segments featured in the earlier episodes.

Caillou's family

Mommy ‚Äì Caillou's mother. She is a busy homemaker most of the time but is seen to work in an office too. Caillou occasionally helps his mom with various chores and she often takes time to involve Caillou and his friends in activities such as crafts and baking. She is predominantly dressed in a red blouse with yellow trim, blue headband, blue ankle-length pants and blue shoes with green soles.

Daddy ‚Äì Caillou's father. He and Caillou occasionally work on projects around the house. He wears a green sweater with a red trim, and blue pants. In the episode ""Caillou The Chef"" he says he once worked at a restaurant and made pizza.

Rosie (French name: Mousseline) ‚Äì Caillou's lively younger sister who is a typical toddler. She always wants to take part in the same activities as Caillou. In later seasons of the series she becomes more talkative and independent. She wears a blue dress, red socks and blue Mary Jane shoes. Rosie sometimes fights with Caillou, but they still love each other. She appears to be the only family member with red hair.

Grandma ‚Äì Caillou's paternal grandmother. Grandma is a very active adult who loves the arts and the outdoors. She passes that love on to Caillou. Grandma often comes up with creative ideas to solve Caillou's problems. She and Caillou paint and go birdwatching together.

Grandpa ‚Äì Caillou's paternal grandfather. He takes Caillou on adventures, often going on walks and riding the bus throughout the town where they reside. In ""Caillou's Hiding Place"", he showed Caillou a hidden area inside a tree in the backyard. In the episode ""Caillou Goes Camping"", he and Caillou camp in the backyard. He is Daddy's father and loves to tell stories about Caillou‚Äôs Daddy when he was a little boy. He wears a blue shirt.

Caillou's friends and neighbours
Mr. Hinkle (French name: Monsieur Lajoie) ‚Äì Caillou's neighbour, he has a gold tooth. In the episode ""Farmer for the Day"", it is said that his first name is Paul.

Leo ‚Äì Leo started out as a mean boy in the 1999 episode ""Caillou Goes to Day Care"", but quickly befriended Caillou in the same episode. They have been inseparable since. According to Caillou's Holiday Movie, Leo is Jewish and celebrates Hanukkah. That was mentioned back in 1999 in the episode ""Caillou Goes to Day Care"".

Clementine ‚Äì Clementine was the first to befriend Caillou in the 1999 episode ""Caillou Goes to Day Care"". She can get rather bossy sometimes, but all in all she is pretty understanding.

Sarah ‚Äì Caillou's friend who he first met in ""Caillou Goes Round the Block"". She is of Chinese heritage and celebrates Chinese New Year. She has a cousin in an episode where she invites Caillou to celebrate Chinese New Year. In another she invites him to school for ""Bring Your Younger Siblings to School Day"" because she has no siblings. Sarah has a pet cat named Olly and a dog named Murphy.

Gilbert ‚Äì Caillou's pet cat. He is the leader of the group. He has a greyish-blue body with black stripes and loathes dogs with a passion. He especially hates the bulldog in the neighbourhood. In the puppet segments of the program, Gilbert often composes odes.

Preschoolers will feel right at home with trusted pal Caillou, his sister Rosie and all their family and friends as they experience the everyday adventures of childhood.

Rs3HnGVQIxI,UNIQUE Vegetarian STREET FOOD Tour in Hyderabad | Live Soda + Ice Cream Dosa + Pav Bhaji Manchuria,"‚ñ∫ More Street Food in Hyderabad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3mt...

‚ñ∫ Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoo...

Even though the city of Hyderabad is more famous for its legendary quintessential non vegetarian wonders that are evidently more conspicuous in its culinary landscape, there is absolutely no dearth of delectable native or popular vegetarian delights in the city. So in this fun filled gastronomic sojourn we braced ourselves to gorge on some delicious vegetarian street side dishes that are widely popular among  the locals. Our host, Sankalp Vishnu, a renowned food expert in the city, took us around the vibrant locality across P G Road, Sindhi colony, Secunderabad that is well known for a wide range of regional vegetarian street food offerings. Let‚Äôs get started.

Our first stop was Top and Tasty, where we tried the Indo chinese style Manchuria pav bhaji. This innovative take on the regular pav bhaji was indeed very delicious. The garlic,red chilli punch as imbibed from the manchurian style of cooking made the dish surprisingly indulgent. 

The second stop was Shivaling Chaat corner where we tried a delicious serving of Hyderabadi style matar(yellow pea) chaat. This savoury and tangy playful dish was topped with sweetened curd, sev and sweet chutney. Unlike its North Indian counterparts, this chaat was served hot. Though that didn't diminish the fun.

The third joint that we stopped by was the Chachaji food cart where we got to taste a delicious Dabeli, a popular Gujarati snack. The perfectly balanced sweet and savoury flavour of the Dabeli was beautifully complemented by the super tasty peanut chutney. It‚Äôs a must try snack if you love the sweet notes in your dish.

The fourth place where we halted was a dosa kiosk named Dosa Verito,right outside the Mayur Pan shop. It boasts of 151 varieties of dosas. After much deliberation we settled for the macaroni pasta dosa and blueberry ice cream dosa. The former one was super cheesy and irresistible while the latter one was a truly luscious fusion treat. 

Our fifth stop was Bombay chaat house where we tried the Hyderabadi version of the Mumbai special Vada Pav. The dry garlic chutney and the unusual garnish of chopped onions enhanced its taste. 

From there we went on to our sixth stop, the Famous and Live Soda where we tried their best selling item the digest soda that is essentially soda mixed with a concentrate prepared with sugar and digestive spices like cumin ,rock salt etc. It was super refreshing and appeasing. 

This delectable veg street food journey concluded with a Paan treat from the popular paan shop in the area the Dimmy‚Äôs Paan Place. Its was a perfect way to end this awesome exploration. 

We confer our heartfelt thanks to Sankalp Bhai for introducing us to the best veg street food offerings.

Thank you for watching this ultimate Kenyan street food tour in Nairobi! I met up with my friend James who took me around to a few of his favorite spots to eat.

Kawangware, Nairobi, Kenya

Here's most of the food we tried on this amazing tour of Nairobi:

Ann Restaurant - Dagoretti Corner - This small street food stall on Dagoretti Corner in Nairobi serves all sorts of Kenyan / East African foods. Their chapatis are especially good, and their Lake Victoria  sardines fried with tomatoes.
Chapati
Dagaa - Lake Victoria sardine
Matumbo - stomach stew
Githeri - beans and maize
The guy sitting across the table - ‚Äúyou should not eat beans and sardines together, or you‚Äôll have gas.‚Äù
Total bill - 1,050 KES ($10.39) - we paid for 4 or 5 guys eating there

Stomach Clinix -  This was  the best  food stop of the day, a neighborhood meat shop that James took me to that specializes in cow head soup. The grilled tongue was also spectacular, but the soup was the best.
Total price - 200 KES ($1.98)

Dagoretti Market -  After the meat, we took a walk over to Dagoretti Market. After browsing around for a while, we stopped for another plate of mixed Kenyan food, mostly dengu, which are mung beans. It was simple, but quite good.
Dengu - mung beans
Total price - 300 KES ($2.97)

Unity Cafe Hotel - We met up with some of James' friend in Kawangware, and went to eat across the street from their shoe shop. The mandazi mix was the highlight of this Kenyan meal.
Total price - 600 KES ($5.94) for all

Cow foot fry - Next we headed over to Oscar who makes cow food soup, fry and boil. He was a very friendly man, and showed me his entire process of making cow foot soup. It was delicious!
Total price - 450 KES ($4.45)

Kenyan street food - To end this Kenyan street food tour of Nairobi we had to eat one of the ultimate Kenyan fast food meat treats. You'll see these types of grills all over the streets in the late afternoon throughout Nairobi. You just choose what you want, it's cut on the chopping board, and you stand and eat.
Esophagus
Intestines
Mutura - minced meat sausage
Mutura - blood sausage
Udder
Total price - 200 KES ($1.97)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Nairobi street food tour!

XAMt-Lxmzd4,ASMR Dog Reviewing Different Types of Food #5 I MAYASMR,"We're back with a new episode of Maya's food review! :)

Info: All tested foods were checked for safety on the American Kennel Club website before feeding. Asparagus (not asparagus ferns!), green (aka bell) pepper, eggplant, kiwi, radishes, mango and lettuce are all safe and contain lots of vitamins. Spaghetti/Pasta in plain form without sauce is safe, too. In general, please feed the foods in moderation and try a small amount if you‚Äôve never given them to your dog before. Each dog is different and might have allergies! Treats should not make up more than 10% of your dog‚Äôs daily diet. 

Besides from these ASMR videos, Maya gets a balanced diet of mostly meat and some veggies/fruits everyday. So she is used to these foods and neither has problems nor gets diarrhea (as some dog ""experts"" here like to claim without even knowing my dog).

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David () and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David () and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5) has long been one of my go-to street food streets in Bangkok. Starting in the evening at around 4 pm, the entire road starts to fill with street food carts selling all sorts of Thai dishes. You‚Äôll find everything from rice and curry to soup noodles, snacks, and fresh fruits and vegetables. It had been a few years since I had explore Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5), so in this Thai street food tour I‚Äôm taking you with me to some of my old favorites, and some new spots. Enjoy!

Yam mama (‡∏¢‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏°‡πà‡∏≤) - 50 THB ($1.52) - This is the first dish I tried. MAMA are Thai instant noodles and this is a completely different way to eat them - in mixed salad form.

Khanom krok (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏Å) - 30 THB ($0.92) - Coconut griddle cakes are one of my favorites, they are crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Don‚Äôt miss this Thai street food snack.

Cha yen (‡∏ä‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏¢‡πá‡∏ô) - 25 THB ($0.76) per cup - Thai tea

Pad thai (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢), Hoy tod (‡∏´‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏î) - This was formerly a street food cart that now has their own permanent shophouse location. They make pretty decent Pad Thai and they hoy tod, which in this case in a mussels omelet, is pretty good as well.
Total price - 125 THB ($3.81)

Nam prik pla too (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏û‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏π) - For something a little healthier, I‚Äôm a huge fan of nam pirk pla too, a pounded chili mackerel sauce that‚Äôs eaten with vegetables.
Total price - 70 THB ($2.14) for everything

Chao guay (‡πÄ‡∏â‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢) - 25 THB ($0.76) - For dessert, I had grass jelly with ice. The owner was so friendly and happy.

Haircut - 100 THB ($3.05)

Pad kra prao moo krob kai dao (‡∏ú‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏Ç‡πà‡∏î‡∏≤‡∏ß) - Final meal of this Bangkok street food tour, I headed across the street to Petchaburi Soi 10 to seek out one of my old time favorites. The stall was still there, and they make a pretty good plate of Thai crispy pork belly fried with basil.
Price - 40 THB ($1.22)

Thank you for joining me on this Thai street food tour of Petchaburi Soi 5 (‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏ä‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏µ ‡∏ã‡∏≠‡∏¢ 5). It‚Äôs the type of street you can walk through and just choose whatever you like to eat.

The markets in Thailand are also a great place to get an insight into Thai culture while you travel in Thailand. You can shop alongside the locals and learn what they buy and eat. And the markets are a great place to try traditional Thai street foods, learn Thai recipes and cooking, as well as eat some of the best Thai dishes in Thailand. You'll see the people cooking the food right in front of you. And best of all, the food is cheap, often much cheaper than eating in a Thai restaurant. Eating at markets is a good way to eat cheap on your Thailand holidays.

Make sure you check out some Thai Food Markets on your trip to Thailand, and be sure to sample some of the amazing Thai street food that's available in Thailand! If you want to try some of the most delicious food in the world be sure to visit Thailand!

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She‚Äôs a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she‚Äôs incredible. Check out her Instagram () and YouTube (). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What‚Äôs key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

But over a year ago, while trying to cook my first food as a foreigner in India, I heard about the controversy for the first time. Apparently non veg people are claiming veg biryani is not real. They're claiming that it's actually a complete different Indian food dish called veg pulao. 

It might be even more strange how a foreigner reacts when hearing this controversy exists. However it is time to settle this Indian food controversy in this foreigner reacts to Indian food biryani controversy.

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?

1aRxeXGoM1,35 SUPERB FOOD HACKS THAT WILL DEFINITELY SURPRISE YOU,"INCREDIBLE FOOD TRICKS

Did you know that there are a lot of secrets about how to make food look irresistible on TV? Usually, burgers, fries, and ice-cream that we see in commercials look mouth-watering but reality never meets expectations. Food should look delicious so that you will want to eat it. In this video, we reveal some secrets of making perfect food photos and you will be shocked by the process of photo making. Sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to make a whole photo session of a product like it, for example, melts too fast as ice-cream does. That‚Äôs why the ice-cream, in fact, is replaced with instant mashed potatoes. Sounds crazy? Yes, but it‚Äôs the only way to make perfect ice-cream shots. Mash potatoes are colored with any color need. The same situation usually occurs when you need to photo cakes with whipped cream. Cream melts too fast and looks awful. So, photographers usually interlay cake layers with cardboard to keep them dry and replace cream with shaving cream. When you buy French fries, they look very disappointing. There is a whole technique on how to make French fries look attractive: kitchen sponge and toothpicks are used to secure fries for making a photo. Photographers add aspirin to soft drinks to look them refreshing and fizzy. 
Check out more kitchen ideas that will ease your life: make a pasta at home; add salt to the milk and it will last longer in the fridge; cover cheese with cheese wax and it will last longer, store cookies in a can with a piece of bread and it will be soft; place celery into the bag with bread to prevent the appearance of mold. Moreover, you will find a cool recipe of black ice-cream that you can make at home in 5 minutes!

i9RDaf8j2Yg,Part 15: Food: How Healthy Was Medieval Food?,"It can be hard to stick to a diet in modern times when eating out. It was much the same for a medieval knight, so when he was dining in his own household his personal physician would work with his cook to keep their master in peak condition. In this episode, Jason and food historian Chris Carr discuss the medieval understanding of nutrition and how it affected the knight‚Äôs diet, as well as the influence of spices and how they defined one‚Äôs social standing.

CURITIBA, BRAZIL - Curitiba is located in the Paran√° state of southern Brazil. It‚Äôs a pleasant city, and they known especially for meat. In this video we go on a Brazilian food tour of Curitiba, explore some of the iconic meat dishes of the city, and eat a 5 kilo family sandwich!   

Mercearia Fantinato - Carne de on√ßa (Jaguar meat), known as jaguar meat, yet of course not jaguar at all, this steak tartare (raw minced beef) got its name because of the raw meat breath you‚Äôll have after you eat it. It‚Äôs mixed table-side, and it‚Äôs delicious.
Price - 53.99 BRL ($13.54)

Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.

4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.

Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It‚Äôs not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)

Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It‚Äôs one of those late night impulse foods - not something I‚Äôd eat on a daily basis.

Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours:  for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven‚Äôt already, watch the full series here:

NGxcr_Z8D,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:

F9To5UjWhUA,Osaka Street Food Guide: Dotonbori ‚òÖ ONLY in JAPAN #23 Â§ßÈò™ÈÅìÈ†ìÂ†ÄÈ£ü„ÅÑÂÄí„ÇåÊåëÊà¶,"Osaka is known as Japan's kitchen and for good reason! It's loaded with some of the best and cheapest restaurants and street stands anywhere. 
Enter Dotonbori, the old entertainment district of Osaka that's also ground zero for cheap and easy to find street food. John Daub and Kevin Riley, a long-term resident of Osaka take their stomachs down the Dotonbori strip. We also introduce a very Osakan word: ""Kuidaore"" meaning eat until you drop! 

Street food on Dotonbori:

‚òÖ Takoyaki„ÄÄ
Called ""octopus ball"" by newbies to Japan, these round treats normally come topped with a tangy thick soy sauce, Japanese mayonaise, and dried fish and seaweed. Some shops go even further adding half boiled eggs or mountains of green negi! 
A bowl of 6 to 8 balls costs 380 to 450 Yen. 
Recommended shop: Creo-Ru Takoyaki
‚òÖ Kushikatsu
Another Osaka specialty you can find at a few stands. It's skewered and battered meats and vegetables deep fried until golden. pTake each skewer and dip it once in the special bath bin near the table or register. You won't be disappointed! Vegetables start at 60 yen and meats at 150 yen. Large Tiger Shrimps can go for 380 yen for one! Prices are listed on the menu outside the shop. 
‚òÖ Gyoza
Osaka has it's own variety of dumplings. What's different? It's cheaper and made in Osaka! 180 yen for 6 gyoza! 
‚òÖ Ramen
A few shops serve up hot bowls on the street side. Get a ticket at the vending machine for about 600 yen and enjoy!
Recommended shop: Kinryu Ramen (The one with the Dragon!)
‚òÖ Crab legs
Who would have thought crab was big in Osaka, but one of the most dominant restaurants serve them char-grilled right at the front of the street. The also have kani miso or ""crab brains"" served in a half shell. 500 yen for that. Yum.
Recommended shop: Kani Doraku
‚òÖ More!!! 
The more you walk around, the more Dotonbori will surprise you.

CJfSYZqZ0Y,The Forested Garden: What is a Food Forest?,"To learn more watch the Permaculture Masterclass, my newest 4-part documentary-style film, here: https://www.discoverpermaculture.com/....

Forests are ecosystems with a diversity of plants, animals, and fungi. They were designed by nature to have perfect balance. A food forest is a version of this in which the different, balanced components produce food. When we understand how nature creates its ecosystem, we can model that with productive species to produce food sustainably, with minimum inputs for maximum outputs. 

Forests have layers. At the top is the (1) canopy layer followed by (2) understory trees, (3) bushes and shrubs, and down to (4) herbaceous layers. Under the ground, there are (5) root yields, and at the surface, there are (6) groundcovers. There are also vertical layers of (7) climbers. These layers work to occupy all the space. In designing a food forest, we use those layers to work for our benefit.

For designed food forests, the plants change from climate to climate. In the subtropics, tamarillo functions as an understory, and also within this layer are productive trees, such as feijoa, guava, and citrus. Taro, coco yam, and cassava are root yields. There are also large herbs, like bananas. The food forest would also include large support species‚Äîice cream bean, tipuana tipu, casuarina‚Äîthat support the forest by cycling nutrients, as well as understory support trees, a la acacia, leucaena, cassia, and albizzia. Most of these support species will eventually give way to large, productive species: rose apples, mulberries, jackfruit, bunya pine, pecan, and mango. The system remains very stable when all the layers are occupied.

We can plant foods by cultivating the support species at the same time as the fruit trees, then managing the support species to shelter and boost the productive species. Or, we can start just support species, but we shouldn‚Äôt start with just the productive species because it would require lots of inputs and hard work to keep them healthy. Support species can be up to 95% of the mass in the early years, and most of them will be nitrogen-fixing species. We speed their life cycle up by managing the support species, pruning when there is more rainfall than evaporation. Over time, less mass will be from support species and more from productive plants until, ultimately, the forest is 95% productive species. This is how we stack in time as well as space.

So, we are manipulating the way a forest grows, particularly speeding it up, to work in our favor. We can pollard nitrogen-fixing legumes to allow sun in during rainier times and, then, through regrowth, supply shades in drier times. We can eventually cut these legumes lower and lower to yield their space to productive species. Finally, we can cut them to ground level and remove them altogether. This is how we more rapidly feed the soil with a fallen forest.

We can also use animals to help in the process. Larger grazing animals can graze to clear areas until we put in our small plants. Chickens and ducks can come through and prepare the ground. With established trees, chicken and ducks can return to clean the area up and speed the cycle of low-lying plants. We just have to keep an eye on the system and work the animals to a planned improvement in productivity.

Food forest work as a living ecosystem, both diverse and stable. The production of soil is constant and fertility constantly growing. The production is nonstop. The system will actually replicate itself over time. This type of garden can make us the most beneficial animal on the planet, all while supplying our own needs.

8Ug1MnU6LK,Unprocessed -- how I gave up processed foods (and why it matters) | Megan Kimble | TEDxTucsonSalon,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. n January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a city-dwelling 26-year-old‚Äîbusy and broke, living in a small apartment without so much as a garden plot to her name. But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.

Megan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",food

CgPXS7K0hJ4,"These 8 ""Healthy"" Foods are Making You Fat!","Get ripped in 90 days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts
Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

Eating healthy is a requirement if you want to get ripped and lose body fat fast.  The problem is, often times foods masquerade themselves as healthy when they are anything but.  In this video, I show you how to spot the 8 biggest healthy foods making you fat.  We call these trap foods because they sneak up on you when you least expect it.

I don‚Äôt care how much you are training or working out, if you refuse to get your nutrition in check you will never look as lean as you should or could.  Proper nutrition and good food choices are required to get ripped.  What I hate however is when you are misled into thinking that certain foods should be in your diet because they are ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.  You blindly trust the guidance and then wind up frustrated when you aren‚Äôt seeing the results for your efforts.  In order to fix this once and for all, you simply have to educate yourself about these traps so you can avoid them in favor of better choices.

First up is guacamole.  Recently, I did a video on how the healthy fats in avocado are great for your body.  The problem is, people confuse healthy foods for lean foods.  Packing a huge calorie wallop with every tablespoon, we tend to overlook the impact eating this food can quickly have on our waistline by eating almost 10-12 tablespoons per serving on average.  Sure, healthy fats are healthy, but like anything else‚Ä¶eaten in excess you will quickly run into trouble with them.

Low fat or lite versions of foods are often way worse than the full fat, regular versions.  Beyond the fact that they usually just do a sugar for fat swap, you‚Äôre also getting a bunch of chemicals thrown in to these highly processed foods that you probably want to avoid all together.

Now I know a lot of people like to have their morning glass of OJ or other fruit juice, but if you are looking to get ripped then you are far better off opting for water and getting your fruit in solid form.  The amount of sugars packed into these ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù drinks is astounding.  In fact, you are likely to find that a comparison between them and a glass of soda yield almost the same amount.  Add in the fact that liquid calories are far too easy to consume (and don‚Äôt provide the fiber benefits of the solid forms) and you‚Äôve got another reason to avoid these.

Sushi is supposed to be a healthy food option that packs a protein punch in the process.  Not so fast.  In fact, with just a sliver of fish in every piece, you‚Äôre getting just 15% protein and instead packing in the starchy carbs with enough sticky rice to hold a small fort together!  Add in the sodium IV drip you‚Äôre getting from your ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù soy sauce and you‚Äôve just made another perfect trap food.  Opt for the sashimi instead and you‚Äôll get what you thought you were getting when you iniitally decided on having sushi.

There‚Äôs something about the word granola that just sounds so healthy.  Maybe it‚Äôs that it sounds like the word grain?  Whatever the case, you can‚Äôt ignore the fact that this is made up of calorically dense ingredients that just won‚Äôt play well in an attempt to lose fat.  If you don‚Äôt make it yourself then you‚Äôre going to be guaranteeing yourself a ton of sugar and syrup as well, as both are needed to hold all of this ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù together.

There are more trap foods not covered here in the description but you will find in this video.  You want to be sure if you are not avoiding them all together that you are at least educated about their pitfalls so you can limit them in your diet when you are trying to get and stay lean.  If you are looking for a complete meal plan to help you get ripped and stay ripped step by step, be sure to head to  and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.

CyI5JBR,7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After),"DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center (https://www.healthpromoting.com/) in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. 

It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. 

You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! 

Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. 

Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.

Tg8b_1GHkCM,Japanese Canned Food & Train Bar,"Japan truly has some of the craziest ideas! KIHA, located in Ningyocho Tokyo, offers food and drinks in a train-themed atmosphere. They offer a variety of canned foods including fish in brine and salted pork and corn, nostalgic snacks that used to be eaten on trains before bento boxes were the norm. 

There is an entrance fee of 500 YEN. However you get a free bowl of rice crackers served to you. Drinks are all you can drink and cost 500 yen for 10 minutes for the first 20 minutes. However if you are planning to stay for at least 30 minutes, the price drops to 300 yen for every 10 minutes. So we suggest you stay for a minimum of 30 minutes as it's actually cheaper that way. Canned food ( warmed up for you ) can be purchased separately and start at around 200 yen per can.

OzA6jRYjVQ,A global food crisis may be less than a decade away | Sara Menker,"Sara Menker quit a career in commodities trading to figure out how the global value chain of agriculture works. Her discoveries have led to some startling predictions: ""We could have a tipping point in global food and agriculture if surging demand surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food,"" she says. ""People could starve and governments may fall."" Menker's models predict that this scenario could happen in a decade -- that the world could be short 214 trillion calories per year by 2027. She offers a vision of this impossible world as well as some steps we can take today to avoid it.

When it comes to food, we all love it! Some of us enjoy it a bit too much! No matter where you go, all over the world, there are exotic delicacies that can open our eyes and tastebuds to new experiences. However, some countries are willing to take some risks when it comes to their food. Whether it‚Äôs because of taste, or the mere need of survival, other cultures are willing to gamble their life for food. Granted, there is also the thrill of trying the dish and it could bring about almost a type of adrenaline rush. If you survive the experience, then you have a story to tell to the ages and gain the accolade of being a bonafide awesome person! For those who aren‚Äôt so lucky after they try an exotic dish, well, their memory will live on as a story to deter others from making the same choice!

6h-EoilCx,BAMBOO NOODLE SLIDE & SAMURAI Food in Kyoto Japan,"If you're looking for a fun place to eat, go to Hirobun. It's in a beautiful and peaceful area where the noodles flow in a long bamboo stick with clear and cold running water through it. But you have to be fast and on your guard for your noodles because they slide by pretty quick!

Then I thought I'd try out some cool Samurai food that was once eaten by actual Samurai's. For Samurai's to stay healthy and fit they ate a lot of vegetables, and I thought it was pretty good although I don't really eat veggies. And to end my fun food day, I went to grab some Okonomu-Yaki. I have to say Manmaru No Tsuki served up some amazing foods here.

5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It‚Äôs definitely something worth knowing if you‚Äôre struggling with excess weight. 

 The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.

Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called blood glucose. If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.

TIMESTAMPS: 
What glycemic index is 
Foods that digest slowly 
Foods that digest moderately 
Foods that digest quickly  
Foods that don‚Äôt have a glycemic index value 
What about pizza?  
Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 

Music by Epidemic Sound  

SUMMARY: 
- The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.
- If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.
- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.
- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.
- There are also foods that really don‚Äôt really have a glycemic index value since they don‚Äôt contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.
- If you‚Äôre having pizza that‚Äôs just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!
- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they‚Äôre processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.

SUMMARY
-A glass of juice contains 5‚Äì6 teaspoons of sugar. The dissolved sugar immediately gets absorbed into the bloodstream, which is bad for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
-Yogurts with fruit contain a lot of sugar, fat, and calories, which all lead to children becoming overweight. It also increases their risk of getting diabetes.
-Flakes, muesli, and other similar cereals contain is a lot of sugar. All the healthy elements of corn, wheat, and oats are removed during production ‚Äî only the carbohydrates are left.
-Honey can cause an allergic reaction, and sometimes honey contains bacteria, which can lead to a serious infectious disease called botulism.
-Grapes are large and slippery, and a child could choke on them. Grapes are also very difficult for a child‚Äôs digestive tract to process.
-No matter how harmless animal-shaped vitamins look, they should only be prescribed by doctors.
-Drinking fatty milkshakes regularly can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.
-French fries, burgers, and pizza are loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.
-Caffeine, which is an ingredient in coffee, could affect calcium absorption, and this might weaken their bones.
-Soda contains calories, artificial sweeteners, and caffeine, all of which erode tooth enamel and cause mood swings.
-Processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, and bologna are rich in sodium and saturated fat. However, when consumed daily and in large amounts, they may increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and spikes in blood pressure.
-Chicken nuggets must go because they‚Äôre packed with preservatives, calories, salt, and a bit of sugar. 
-Potato chips contain loads of sodium and fat. Chips should never land in your grocery basket, and they should stay out of your child‚Äôs life as well.
-Ketchup is made from sugar, corn syrup, food coloring, and extra fat.
-Mac and cheese contains sodium, food preservatives, and noodles stripped of fiber. This same goes for canned spaghetti and ramen in plastic packages. 
-Canned tuna contains high levels of mercury, which is dangerous for their health.
-Cake, cookies, doughnuts, candies, and fruit snacks can cause tooth decay and cavities.
-According to the FDA, unpasteurized milk carries dangerous bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria.

f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.

A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.

Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.

In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.

For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.

Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. 

In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.

There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food. 

This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in July 2008.

03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?

Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.

TJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

Y81rCiw1LPY,Food betrayal -- don‚Äôt swallow the lies | Alan Lewis | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. As an industry insider, Alan Lewis knows just how badly the food system is broken. In this high energy TEDx talk, Alan reveals the sophisticated methods used by the food industry ‚Äúfibberati‚Äù to manipulate, deceive and distract us. If you have ever read a food label and felt you were being lied to, you have felt the ‚Äúdark mark‚Äù of the fibberati.  We can resist these nefarious tactics by making conscious food choices based on core values that support a sustainable and just food system.

Alan directs Government Affairs and Food and Agriculture Policy for Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, a 60-year-old health food chain operating over 85 stores in fifteen states. He is active in many trade organizations and sits on the Boulder County Food and Agriculture Policy Council. His focus is on communicating with local and federal policy makers using frameworks that are non-confrontational and inclusive -- except for tonight. He has lived for extended periods in Portugal, Haiti, and Dominica, where he developed a keen appreciation for the variables of agriculture production and food systems within different geographic, cultural and economic contexts. 

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",food

SIdv_pnkHJk,Opening decades-old canned foods,"Read!!! Be Safe, Don't trust food this old, not worth the risk. I actually found them in the basement at someones estate sale and bought them. Some are badly rusted. The one from 85 I think was real tin and that's why it didn't rust like the iron ones. Something may have been wrong with them so i didn't try them. I buried them in a compost pile afterwards, it rotted away. Personally I only trust cans up to three years old but if it's like evaporated milk-dairy not long at all. Thanks For Watching",food

xnKaOL2IBPY,"Food as Medicine | Michael Greger, M.D. | TEDxSedona","According to the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest study of disease risk factors in history; funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) the #1 cause of both death and disability in the United States is our diet. Cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet appears to kill hundreds of thousands more. The good news is that means we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity. Healthy eating has the potential to not only prevent, but reverse some of our leading causes of death including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Why, then, is nutrition not the #1 thing taught in medical school? American physician, author, and speaker on public health issues, particularly the benefits of a whole foods, plant-based diet and the harms of eating animal products. He is a vegan and the creator of NutritionFacts.org. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",food
DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it‚Äôs not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. 
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it‚Äôs pink, purple, or red, it‚Äôs most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. 
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. 
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils‚Äô trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn‚Äôs almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn‚Äôt contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

We asked people who are learning Dutch which typical Dutch dishes they know, and what they think about the Dutch cuisine (Nederlandse keuken).

What about the eating habits? How does a Dutch meal at dinner look like? Is it always potatoes + meat + a vegetable...? How about lunch... preparing sandwiches at home to take them with you to school or work?

5oQbCOz9nlU,Food for thought: China's Food Safety | 101 East,"Every year two million people die from unsafe food and water around the world. Food safety experts warn these deaths may be caused by human design, and nowhere is this trend more prevalent than in China.

Tracing the making of a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a 101 East investigation exposes the toxic stew this iconic dish has become.

From tainted additives in noodles to growth hormones in pork, to industrial filler posing as meat, presenter Steve Chao finds that anything is possible for producers looking to cut corners and make a fast buck.

Do you have a story about Chinese food you consumed?  @AJ101East goes undercover to expose the hidden harm in China's Food Industry.

96osGZaS74,How To End The Food Waste Fiasco | Rob Greenfield | TEDxTeen,"There are millions around the world who don‚Äôt know where their next meal will come from. Rob is on a mission to solve this problem.  We can all easily be a part of the solution‚Ä¶ and it starts with a dumpster.

TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoe

Rob is an adventurer, activist, and dude making a difference. His purpose is to inspire health, happiness, and freedom on Earth and he‚Äôs dedicated his life to this mission. He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",food
PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

Take 4-5 rounds of brie, cut the tops from brie and wrap in the dough and place the brie ‚Äútower‚Äù in the center of the baking tray. Put jacket potatoes around, spray potatoes with olive oil and add any spicy you like and bake for 60 minutes. Yummy! Another cool idea is to cool camembert with vegetables. Baked camembert with vegetables topping recipe: cut the camembert in half and place one half in the middle of pastry circle, add vegetable topping and potato slices. Cut the pastry in 8 parts, it will look like a flower. Use a glass to cut a circular line at the end of each petal. Fold petals one by one and brush with egg wash. Bake.

U8u1Aydxjl4,10 Normal Foods That Are BANNED In Other Countries,"Popular food you cannot find in other countries.
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/cv6b96
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat, milk, cereal, and fruit are products Americans consume on a regular basis. But did you know that some of these products are completely banned in other countries? They contain substances and chemicals that might be approved by the FDA, but are illegal by any other food administration. Let‚Äôs explore 10 foods banned in other countries!


Let‚Äôs start with artificial dyes. You probably know that M&Ms and other sweets contain artificial dyes that contribute to the product‚Äôs color and make it more appealing. But those dyes have been banned in Europe and many other countries around the world and replaced with natural dyes as they contain several harmful substances!

Wild salmon is considered as one of the healthiest foods with plenty of nutritional benefits. But did you know that many countries banned farm-raised salmon? Wait until you hear just how harmful salmon is for the environment and why it‚Äôs been banned in Australia as well as New Zealand!

We often hear about zero-calorie chips which are considered healthy. It‚Äôs due to a fat substitute called Olestra. But this substitute seems to have negative effects on our health! While it removes fat from products, it actually stops the body from receiving some of the most essential vitamins and nutrients, which is why it was banned in Canada and Europe.

Do you consume meat, Rice Krispies, sports drinks, calorie-free snacks, fruit, or GMO food? All of those have been banned from countries around the world because they include harmful substances that have negative effects on your health!

Not only do these meals help you lose weight fast, but they'll also help you build lean muscle mass. Some of these are my person favorites so I truly consider these some of the best diet foods for weight loss for both men & women. You can create your own meal plan with these. Enjoy!

If you're seriously trying to lose belly fat then you already know that diet is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle. With a proper diet plan where you're eating the right foods in the right amounts you'll strip off layer after layer of body fat and say goodbye to that belly forever. However, if you're eating the wrong things you'll only be setting yourself back further and further. With an improper diet plan you'll have to get used to loosening your belt notch after notch because your belly fat will be there to stay. So to ensure that you aren't making any mistakes with the food you're selecting I want to go over the 20 best foods that you should be eating regularly to lose that belly fat for good. The first food I want to start with is the avocado. Unlike other fruits that are loaded with carbs, Avocados are full of healthy monounsaturated fats specifically oleic acid. They are also full of fiber which will help you feel full for longer. Another great thing about avocados that was discovered during a study from The Ohio State University at Columbus is that avocados help you absorb more cartenoids from fruits and vegetables, up to 15x more to be exact. So not only will avocados help you burn fat, but you'll also be strengthening your immune system and absorbing more cancer fighting cartenoids than ever. Next we have eggs. Eggs are great to incorporate into your diet plan because they‚Äôre high in protein, high in healthy fats and they can help you feel full for a very low amount of total calories. Eggs are also one of the most bioavailable sources of protein out there. Meaning that your body can very efficiently digest, absorb, and assimilate the protein found in eggs. Having a solid protein source like eggs in your diet will help you prevent muscle loss while you eat less calories to create enough of a deficit to burn fat. Lets move on to one of the best fruits you can eat while trying to lose belly fat...berries. Compared to most other fruits berries are very low in carbohydrates, while being full in vitamins and antioxidants. These antioxidants can help improve blood flow delivering more oxygen to your muscles and your cells in general. Ultimately this can hep improve your workouts while assisting with the fat loss process. The best low carb berries to eat are blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Blueberries are going to be a bit higher in carbs, so to keep calories low stick with the other 3. The next food isn't really a food, but instead its a drink that's been proven very effective at helping you fight that belly fat...apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to help people lose weight and waist circumference. These aren't they typical animal studies that you constantly see that don't necessarily guarantee the same results for people. Instead these are human studies. One of these studies was 12 weeks long and it demonstrated that obese individuals could lose anywhere from 2.6 to 3.7 pounds just by consuming 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per day. It has also been shown to improve blood sugar spikes after meals, and it can help increase fullness after a meal. In fact one study showed that taking apple cider vinegar with a high carb meal could result in people eating 200 to 275 less calories for the day. Keep in mind, you want to make sure that you dilute only one to two tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar in water. Don't drink it straight up. Next I have another high protein food for you and that's tuna. Tuna is a very lean fish that's pretty much entirely made up of protein. This makes tuna a great option to increase protein intake without increasing calorie intake too much. The important thing is if you're buying canned tuna you want to make sure you get the tuna in water not oil. If you get it in oil then all the extra calories that you save from this low fat fish will be canceled out. Fish in general is a great option for when you're trying to burn fat

HwRYUmToqLY,BEST AMSTERDAM FOOD EVER! | Top 7 Dutch Street Foods üá≥üá± Albert Cuyp Market,"Eating delicious food such as waffles, cheesy chicken sandwich, raw fish, gouda cheese & more! THUMBS UP & SUBSCRIBE!! 
Eating the best Dutch street food in Amsterdam 
Subscribe to our channel: 
Check out yesterday's vlog:

PATRON: 

In this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. 

Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. 

Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. 

A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:

I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. 

Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into ‚ÄúNew Herring.‚ÄùThis means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.

After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. 

Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!

After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into ‚Äúnut bar‚Äù) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  

Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. 

I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

TKyY5zhrlfQ,15 Foods That Reduce Your Heart Attack Risk According to Doctors,"Do you want to clean your blood vessels? How to decrease the risk of heart attacks in the future? Are you ready to improve your overall well-being? Here are 15 food products that can take care of your heart and prevent heart diseases. 

Our heart is one of the most important organs, but, surprisingly, we take care of it the least, loading it every day with stress and unhealthy diets. And that's too bad because fatty food increases cholesterol levels, which leads to vascular plaques that prevent the heart from working correctly. In this video, you will get familiar with 15 products that perform all these activities! Some of them might surprise you with their health benefits!
Watch till the end - as a bonus, you will find a recipe for a special drink for healthy blood vessels. And remember to press the like button in appreciation of our work!

TIMESTAMPS
Fatty fish 
Oatmeal 
Berries 
Dark chocolate 
Nuts 
Extra virgin olive oil 
Red wine 
Green tea 
Broccoli and spinach 
Avocado 
Pomegranate 
Cinnamon 
Watermelon 
Garlic 
Apples and pears 

SUMMARY
- Salmon, mackerel, herring, haddock, and other fatty fish decrease the risk of arrhythmia and atherosclerosis. They also contain lots of vitamins as well as minerals. 
- Rich in fiber, porridge decreases the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol and improves digestion. Coarse oatmeal is the healthiest. 
- Blueberries and strawberries are very good at lowering blood pressure and dilating blood vessels. Strawberry-lovers also get fiber, folate, antioxidants, and potassium from their favorite berries. 
- Dark chocolate provides the anti-stress effect as it increases the production of serotonin which is known for its calming effect. Cocoa, the main component of dark chocolate, also helps to prevent memory decline. 
- Nuts contain protein fibers that are useful for the heart. They also have vitamin E as their ingredient which helps to decrease the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol. 
- Olive oil is very high in oleic acid which reduces blood pressure. It is interesting that when the olives are crashed, oil leaves them naturally; therefore, beneficial ingredients and vitamins are not harmed by chemicals or preservatives. 
- French scientists have also found out that red wine contains some elements which can prolong a human lifespan for about 60 percent! Saying this, it still should be consumed in moderation. 
- Green tea makes the brain function better. This drink may decrease the risk of different types of cancer (such as prostate and breast cancer).
- Broccoli, in particular, has a lot of medicinal benefits, such as prevention of some kinds of cancer, digestive system improvement, detoxification of the body. It also resembles a vitamin injection, filling you with numerous vitamins and minerals. 
- Avocados are packed with fiber, which can be useful for weight loss, blood sugar reduction, and other health-benefitting processes. 
- Pomegranates contain antioxidants, lower blood pressure, normalize blood circulation and increase hemoglobin levels. 
- Cinnamon can protect you from heart diseases and atherosclerosis. It also boosts metabolism and helps you to lose weight. 
- Watermelon plays an important role in vascular health. It stabilizes the cholesterol levels and contains antioxidants. It provides hydration, which is a great thing for your body. 
- Garlic dilates the vessels, lowers blood pressure, alleviates vasoconstriction, and prevents atherosclerotic plaques from appearing. It improves digestion as well, assisting in the functioning of the intestines. 
- Apples and pears are rich in fiber that helps your heart. They normalize blood circulation and are cheaper and more readily available alternatives to pomegranates. Besides, apples will help to maintain white and healthy teeth.

lwgXXVXM3I,"Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

P2BVyHOdFU,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they‚Äôre sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they‚Äôre cooked.

TIMESTAMPS: 
Mushrooms 
Eggs 
Rice 
Breast milk or formula 
Chicken and processed meat 
Potatoes 
Celery, spinach, and beets 

  

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY:
- Whether they‚Äôre in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it‚Äôs reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave‚Äôs high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won‚Äôt kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it‚Äôs time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food‚Äôs protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it‚Äôs probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they‚Äôre prepared, they‚Äôre more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop ‚Äúblue baby syndrome,‚Äù which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don‚Äôt forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.

1r0ocJbsY-g,Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food,"Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food

Exploring the cultural diversity exemplified throughout the vibrant street food scene in New York City.
Known as the Big Apple, New York City is home to about nine million people [‚âà population of Honduras, nation] and hosts an additional 40 million visitors every year, which makes for a lot of stomachs to feed. 

Quick snacks, above all the hot dog, are as synonymous with New York as yellow cabs and skyscrapers and reflect the city's eclectic ethnic mix.

Yet few people realise that many of the city's thousands of street vendors - including Brooklyn's famed 'Falafel King' - face a daily struggle that belies the city's wealthy and glamourous image.

As the first signs of Manhattan's morning hustle and bustle surface, the city's street vendors have already been at work for many hours. Storage garages are busy with the sound of these business owners cleaning and gleaming, stocking and getting things in order for their long days ahead.

Although there are many vendors native to NYC, there is a significant number of immigrant owners - many of whom have run their businesses for decades.

Their food carts symbolise a lot more than a quick and convenient snack for the hundreds of thousands that pound the pavements of the city. They are a chance to live life on their own terms, often after escaping political turmoil or significant economic instability in their homelands. 

But the challenge is far from ideal. Obstacles to a successful business range from finding the perfect selling spot - in spite of an unspoken brotherhood between the vendors that can and has led to rivalries - and adhering to legislation surrounding health and safety, to liquidity and endless working hours. 

On the other side of the river, street vendors in Brooklyn and Queens face an even tougher uphill battle. Catering to a rougher demographic, and often without the means - both financial and otherwise - food cart owners, many of whom are new to the US, tend to find themselves operating illegally and, at times, even dangerously. 

Follow this episode of Street Food to get a glimpse into the good, the bad and the delicious of New York's vendors.

Editor's note: This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in 2008.

Just to be clear, this video is not sponsored or endorsed by any of the restaurants depicted, or any other company. This was in fact a hidden camera expos√©, and no foods were tampered with in any way.  They were all served to me exactly as they appear in the video. 

And in case you're wondering what I did with all of this food, my cameraman ate some of it and I gave the rest to the workers who were painting my next door neighbor's house.

3n8gZvEew9g,"8 Popular Foods We Don't Eat Anymore, Here's Why","What foods do you buy daily? How about SunnyD? Or maybe congealed salad is the thing you can't live without? Yup, these foods are so unpopular now! However, just 20‚Äì40 years ago they were flying off the grocery store shelves!

TV Dinners 
Congealed Salads 
SunnyD 
Hi-C 
Bubble Tape 
Ambrosia Salad 
Crisco 
Cottage Cheese 

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY:
- TV dinners first stepped onto the scene in the 1950s when Swanson was looking for a way to sell their Thanksgiving food leftovers. They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.
- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma‚Äôs house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.
- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast ‚Äî and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. 
- One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day ‚Äî and these were intended for kids! 
- Back in the late ‚Äô80s and ‚Äò90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn‚Äôt as desirable anymore.
- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. 
- Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‚Äò90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.
- It wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It‚Äôs very mild in flavor and isn‚Äôt super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‚Äò50s into the ‚Äò70s.

LYRICS:
I ºll start with a taco, soft like a cloud 
I want mine crunchy, I like to eat loud. 
I ºll choose a chalupa, I ºll grab a gordita, 
and two taco salads for our senoritas. 
And a Burrito Supreme, with extra sour cream 
It ºs a cylindrically shaped seasoned beef dream. 
A taquito. An enchirito. Some cinnamon twists. 
A chicken border bowl.  Are you gettin º all this? 

And you know that nothing beats a 
hmmm, mmmm...Mexican Pizza... 
We ºll take two of those, but please hold the diced tomatoes. 
And I admit, I ºve always felt, 
like I ºm in love with the meximelt. 
Make mine with a little extra love, and think of me... 
as the cheese drops from your Taco Bell glove. 
 and that ºs it.  

No! I ºm not done...I ºll also take a... 

Double-decker taco cause I ºm feeling wild 
And make my sauce Fire. Uh, he ºll take mild. 
and we ºll take two Mt. Dew Baja blasts 
for a chance at 25 dollars cash 
I ºm told there ºs a winner for every 5 minutes 
I ºm stealing your online code if you win it. 
Why would you do that? You owe me 25 bones 
I owe you 5.  Plus interest--it was a loan. 
And I think we ºll be satisÔ¨Åed, if we get some mexican rice on the side. 
And that ºs it.",food

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

Lyrics:

Intro (spoken)

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

Chorus
(same as before)

W2L_02p-xn,6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!,"These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier.

The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA‚Äôs that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They‚Äôre found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body‚Äôs cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you‚Äôve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there‚Äôs an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body‚Äôs levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It‚Äôs the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don‚Äôt contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you‚Äôll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta‚Äô cut back on the booze.  Here‚Äôs why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They‚Äôre a preservative that has been added to beer for

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below‚Ä¶

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

Written by: LIONEL BART

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

Food glorious food
Were anxious to try it
3 banquets a day
Our favourite diet
Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or chewed
For food marvelous food wonderful food magical food fabulous food beautiful food

RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""

In today's video we highlight a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices which have little to no carbs and no sugar. These are practical when on a no sugar diet, or low carb diet such as the ketogenic or carnivore diet. High amounts of sugar taken regularly will cause damage to the body and chronic inflammation over time. Reducing these and eating healthier sources of vitamins and minerals will help your body to get back into sync and heal itself naturally.

Increasing access to fresh fruit and vegetables with a minimum of two portions of veg and a portion of fruit to be offered as part of a school lunch
Introducing lower sugar limits, for example for foods such as breakfast cereal and yoghurts
Reducing how often sweetened and baked goods are available in primary schools

1hizzP-LFL,3 p.m. | It‚Äôs a Setup | Food Town | PBS Food,"Immediately after lunch rush, the early-riser chefs call it day. For other restaurant owners, the day is just beginning. During that afternoon golden hour when everything seems shut down downtown, chefs are behind the scenes either cleaning and closing up shop, like Ricky Moore at Saltbox Seafood Joint, or hustling in the kitchen to square away dinner service, like longtime chef-restaurateur Scott Howell (Nana‚Äôs, Nanasteak, Bar Virgile).

In Food Town USA, a day in Durham is sliced, fried, and diced into a fast-paced countdown of 24 hours inside the Bull City‚Äôs hip and happening restaurant scene. Viewers meet the eccentrics, gastro-nerds and entrepreneurs who helped create the South‚Äôs recently-crowned ‚ÄúTastiest Town.‚Äù Packed with flavorful explorations from sunup to sundown, Food Town takes viewers inside kitchens and dining rooms.

KoUcEcz1dM,8 Foods that Are Actually Damaging Your Kidneys,"Have you ever noticed that final powerful spray of water at the carwash before your vehicle gets a rapid blow dry? The water jets pulverize any remaining remnants of dirt.

That‚Äôs one way to view how our kidneys work. Their job is to flush out toxins from the blood by way of urine. The National Institutes of Health reports that our kidneys filter an excess of 200 quarts of blood daily. That translates into 2 quarts of waste each day. They don‚Äôt get holidays or weekends off; they work day and night.

Thankfully, our kidneys can wash away impurities while retaining vital nutrients floating around in our blood. Keeping our internal filters healthy and functioning properly is invaluable for nourishment and detoxification of our bodies. 

So naturally, whatever we eat and drink has a dramatic impact on our kidneys‚Äô health. A steady diet of unhealthy food and drinks can strain their performance, and put us at risk.

The good news is, it‚Äôs never too late to improve your diet and lifestyle, even if your kidneys are already impaired.
 
In today‚Äôs video we will see how our kidneys react to too much consumption of 8 different foods and beverages.

1. Red meat
We‚Äôve all heard that protein is good for our health. But too much of anything can be harmful. For example, a diet that is high in red meat, which contains lots of animal protein, can damage our kidneys. The reason? Our kidneys need to metabolism this protein. 

When there‚Äôs a conveyor belt of rich protein headed toward the kidneys for cleansing, they  just can‚Äôt keep up with the pace. When kidneys can‚Äôt eliminate waste products, there will be a build-up of acidic residue in our body.
It‚Äôs always good to talk to your health care professional about the diet that‚Äôs right for you.

2.  Alcohol
Just like eating too much red meat can strain our kidneys, the same is true with too much alcohol; they will be unable to properly filter our blood. Also, too much alcohol can cause dehydration. This creates a domino effect: if our blood is dehydrated, our cells and organs will not be able to function properly.

3. Table Salt
While our bodies require sodium to maintain proper fluid balance ‚Äì especially in our electrolytes - an excess amount will cause kidneys to retain water. Too much salt can also increase the amount of protein that is eliminated in urine.

4. Caffeine
Caffeine is a stimulant which millions of people depend upon every morning to help them become fully awake. But all of that caffeine in coffee, tea and sodas can jolt your kidneys into overdrive. The stimulant accelerates blood flow, which in turn increases blood pressure.

Caffeine has another effect ‚Äì it can lead to dehydration, just as salt can. Too much dehydration can lead to kidney stones. Most health experts recommend you drink no more than 2 cups of coffee or 3 cups of tea daily. Soda and energy drinks are beverages you may want to eliminate completely. Another source of caffeine is cocoa, which should also be consumed moderately.

5. Artificial Sweeteners
Refined sugar has had a bad rap lately. That‚Äôs why companies began creating artificial sweeteners. It may sound better for our health, but they can still negatively impact kidney function. Try instead to steer away from artificial sweeteners and use stevia or honey to flavor your food and beverages.

6. Dairy Products
While dairy products are an excellent source of protein, they should be consumed in moderation, especially for anyone who has kidney disease. The reason?  Too many dairy products will increase calcium in urine which can lead to kidney stones. Also, as kidneys are overworked, they won‚Äôt be able to regulate protein waste and it will rise to an unhealthy level.

7. Carbonated Beverages
Sodas and energy drinks are usually the chief instigator for kidney problems; they are loaded with caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners. They may taste better than thirst-quenching water or lemon water but they aren‚Äôt providing any health benefits for your kidneys.  
 
8. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs)
In recent years, crops have been the recipient of various forms of herbicides and pesticides. This includes everything from strawberries to rice.

The 2-acre property has been transformed from a neglected piece of land into a thriving ecosystem of native and exotic trees where birds and insects live in abundance. Robert and Robyn are a huge inspiration to us, not only for their beautiful approach to healing the land and saving heritage trees and seeds, but for the way they‚Äôve impacted on their local community.

They‚Äôve operated an environment centre in their town for over 20 years, where the community comes together to learn and discuss, buy produce and sit by the warm fire over a cuppa. We‚Äôve even heard of folk who‚Äôve up and moved to Riverton because they‚Äôre so inspired by the Guytons!

L4KRCY3h4gA,Top 12 Super Foods That Fight Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a disease caused by our bodies cellular unbalance. It‚Äôs most commonly found in women.

Early diagnosis is the best way to effectively treat breast cancer, so getting an annual mammogram is one of the best ways for women over 40 to prevent this disease.

Aside from early diagnosis, keeping your cells balanced and free of harmful free radicals is the second best way to avoid this disease.

So, here is a list of foods that contain chemical compounds that help slow the development of cancer.

Green Tea

Green tea is rich in polyphenols and catechins. These substances are antioxidants that protect our cells from DNA damage caused by free radicals. One cup of green tea per day is the recommended amount.

Pomegranate juice

Pomegranate juice also contains polyphenols. According to recent studies, pomegranate juice has the potential to be a preventative tool for certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. 

Blueberries, strawberries and black raspberries

These fruits contain large quantities of polyphenols, that may contain anticancer properties. Furthermore, they are rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin C. You should eat from ¬æ of a cup to 1 cup of fruit a day. 

Plums and peaches

Studies indicate that the polyphenols found in plums and peaches can help prevent breast cancer cell formation and keep them from multiplying. 
Evidence suggest that polyphenols help kill cancerous cells, without harming healthy cells.

Cruciferous vegetables
These vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants (such as vitamins C, E and K) and fiber. The most popular cruciferous vegetables are:

- Broccoli;
- Cauliflower;
- Brussel sprouts;
- Arugula;
- Cabbage. 

Green vegetables

The greener the vegetable, the denser the nutrients. Green vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants and fibers, which makes them valuable tools against cancer.

Carotenoids

Carotenoids are found in red, orange, dark green and yellow fruits and vegetables. These foods are very rich in vitamin A, lutein, beta carotene and lycopene, all of which are effective against free radicals. 

Apigenin

Apigenin is a flavonoid found in certain fruits, vegetables and herbs. As apigenin is an antioxidant, these foods may have anti-inflammatory properties as well.

The most common sources of apignenin are:
- Parsley; 
- Celery; 
- Chamomile; 
- Mint; 
- Spinach; 
- Licorice. 

Omega-3 Fatty Acids 

Found abundantly in cold water fish, omega-3 fatty acids are an essential nutrient for the functioning of your immune system.

The most common sources of Omega-3 are:

- Salmon; 
- Sardines; 
- Herring; 
- Fish oils, such as cod liver oil. 

Whole grains

Whole foods also tend to be high in anticancer polyphenols, they usually include other essential nutrients such as fiber, magnesium and protein.

Some examples of whole grains are:

- Brown rice;
- Oats;
- Corn;
- Barley. 

Peppers 

Both dehydrated and fresh peppers contain capsaicin. This component is a very powerful antioxidant in the fight against free radicals and it also has anticancer power. The hotter the pepper, the higher the concentration of capsaicin.

Garlic

Garlic is especially effective for people suffering from breast cancer that have a reaction with estrogen. 

Saffron
Saffron has curcumin that helps decrease the toxic effects of certain breast cancer cells and can inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

Always remember that breast cancer treatment should be overseen by a doctor, however, these tips may help to complement it, so talk to your doctor about these foods.

Rescuers Discover The Heartbreaking Reason This Cat Only Accepts Food In Bags
Homeless cat only accepts food in bags so she can feed her only kitten

Life on the streets isn‚Äôt easy for cats. While house cats enjoy a pampered existence, strays forced to live in the elements struggle every single day to survive.

If you‚Äôve ever fed a stray cat, then you know just how rough life can be for them‚Äîand how appreciative they are of free meals. While they might be wary of people, if there is food to offer, strays will scarf it all down as quickly as they can before bounding off to safety.

That‚Äôs what makes this story so special. When a volunteer from a local animal shelter noticed the strange way one cat was eating food, she decided to follow her. What she discovered changed the way she saw every animal around her‚Ä¶

Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute at the University of Nebraska was established to address one of the most urgent challenges of the 21st century with significant political, environmental, social and economic implications: how to achieve greater food security with less pressure on water resources. At present, almost a billion people in the world are food-insecure, without access to enough safe and nutritious food to lead healthy and active lives. Many of them are also water-insecure, without reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water to meet their needs, while also exposed to the risks of droughts and floods. To ensure sustainable global food and water security in the face of population and income increases, a changing climate and the growing demand for scarce water resources, it is imperative to improve water use and management in agricultural and food systems.

Eating enough food is the biggest when it comes to putting on weight as a skinny guy.

For a little while, I stopped focusing on this one critical factor and noticed it was significantly harder to get enough food in.

When I started prioritizing food first thing in the morning, it became much easier to eat enough food.

The longer you delay putting food in you, the smaller your ""eating window"" for the day is.

If you wake up at 6:45am and start eating at 9am versus 7am you've lost 2 hours off your eating window.

Those 2 hours are a great opportunity to take in 500-800 calories and start your day off with a bang!

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. 

One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world‚Äôs cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they‚Äôre made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they‚Äôre so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. 

A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It‚Äôs basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that‚Äôs deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‚Äòfrinkandel speciaal‚Äô is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. 

Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It‚Äôs melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that‚Äôs then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It‚Äôs pretty much deep fried cheese so what‚Äôs not to love?

Krokets are a Dutch food you‚Äôll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it‚Äôs also deep fried. It‚Äôs long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It‚Äôs crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it‚Äôs still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They‚Äôre very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. 

We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. 

I included fries in this video even though they‚Äôre Belgian, not Dutch. But they‚Äôre really popular in The Netherlands and I didn‚Äôt think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. 

I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I‚Äôd love to know which food you‚Äôd most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you‚Äôve already tried them, which is your favourite?

Please note:  I am not medically trained nor am I promoting any product.  This video clip was created as part of an educational assignment and should be treated as such.  Thank you to those who have watched it and have commented both positively and negatively.  It is great to see people exchanging ideas, views and opinions.  Thank you again.

Hi again to all of you who have viewed and commented on my 'school' project.  I appreciate your comments and concerns and once again want to clarify that i undertook this small project, researching reputable sites, and acknowledged that i am not medically trained.  I can however say that many diabetics suffer their diabetes differently.  My husband WAS a Type 2 Diabetic but due to calorie control, cutting back on high processed carbs/sugars and a little bit of walking has managed after 10 years to come off his insulin and is now classified by his specialist as a NON DIABETIC.  Many of you are pushing alternative treatments, selling products etc that I do not and cannot recommend through this YouTube clip.  Please respect each other's views and use this clip as a guide and not as gospel.  Do some research of your own and take control of your health.  All the best. Liz :)",food
TeLiBBxI,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it‚Äôs rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you‚Äôre not allowed to eat in the US

Subscribe to American Eye 

6. Mirabelle Plum
Don‚Äôt get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won‚Äôt get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal‚Äù? They‚Äôre just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It‚Äôs somewhat of a mystery why exactly they‚Äôre banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It‚Äôs a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren‚Äôt allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 

5. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860‚Äôs and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it‚Äôs from the mom to the offspring

4. Lazy Cakes
This cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn‚Äôt found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 


3. Pig‚Äôs Blood Cake
Who on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig‚Äôs blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It‚Äôs basically like a street food delicacy that‚Äôs made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it‚Äôs still banned here!


2. Conch Queen
This beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It‚Äôs actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.  


Purple Mangosteen 
One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn‚Äôt eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it‚Äôs found in the US! The problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don‚Äôt want this thing in our country! It‚Äôs been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",food
PqR7wtOtyzM,10 Foods Made in China You Must Avoid,"10 Foods Made in China You Must Avoid 


China is well known for its great cuisine and specific taste as well as many different products we use daily. Chinese restaurants are spread all around the globe and it is slowly creating a cult of the Chinese culture. However, lately there are some rumors about lack of standards in Chinese products and people slowly start to avoid importing Chinese goods and is very easy to understand why.

Another thing which is China known for are its fake, cheap products sold all around the world via Amazon, eBay, AliExpress and many more online websites. These products are very cheap and lack quality. They often contain prohibited toxic substances and are fake. These online sites offer food shipped directly from the country.

guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,"Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America‚Äôs most critical ‚Äì and challenging ‚Äì public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University‚Äôs human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

Three variants are available from launch; the BMW X2 sDrive20i petrol model with 192 horsepower (141 kW), plus the X2 xDrive20d diesel variant with 190 hp (140 kW) and X2 xDrive25d diesel with 231 hp (170 kW).

F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July ‚Äì 12 November 2017) 

Sponsored by MADE.COM. Supported by the American Friends of the V&A

Consisting of turning and adaptive milling on a Hermle C50U MT mill/turn machining centre. By combining innovative 5-axis machining strategies with conical barrel cutters (supplied by Technicut), the milling cycle time was slashed from 200 hours to 35 (a saving of 83%) or ¬£18,150 per blade. At the same time, tooling costs were reduced by 72%.

Once complete, the full blisk was polished using a Fanuc M-710iC industrial robot cell.

x5QRIDwQo3,Gov't announces plans to boost manufacturing sector,"ÏÇ∞ÏóÖÎ∂Ä, Ï†úÏ°∞ÏóÖ Î•¥ÎÑ§ÏÉÅÏä§ ÎπÑÏ†Ñ Î∞è Ï†ÑÎûµ Î∞úÌëú

The trade ministry has announced details of its own... on measures to revitalize the country's manufacturing sector,... aimed at transforming South Korea into the world's fourth-largest exporter. 
Kim Hyesung reports. 
Restructuring existing industries, finding new growth engines, nurturing talent and attracting more investment.
That's the government's plan to boost its manufacturing sector,... which accounts for nearly a third of the country's GDP,... but is hobbled by its stagnant automobile and shipbuilding industries,... and a lack of new businesses to drive future growth. 
The government's goal is to raise the proportion of value-added industries in manufacturing... from the current 25 percent... to the OECD average of around 30 percent. 
To nurture new industries and develop new products,... the government will push for structural changes... by introducing more smart factories, as well as AI and robots. 
In particular, the government will invest over seven billion US dollars in three new industries... including future cars, non-memory chips, and biotech.
This will be backed up by private sector investment of more than 153 billion US dollars... by the year 2030. 
""To push for qualitative growth in manufacturing amid fiercer global competition, government support and investment is important. But with convergence between manufacturing, services and IT becoming the new trend in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, easing regulations in Korea is actually more important to boost innovation.""
In fact, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry's poll on 500 local manufacturing firms Tuesday... shows that two out of three surveyed... haven't found new businesses to drive sustainable future growth.
They are also losing competitiveness,... caught in between firms from advanced countries and emerging economies. 
The trade ministry said it will develop a detailed plan to boost the country's manufacturing sector,... by nurturing talent in engineering and manufacturing,... and providing tax incentives as well as financial support... for startups and mid-sized firms.

L3CkzQQFZX,Additive Manufacturing - LASERTEC 65 3D,"The unique combination of laser deposition welding with a powder nozzle and milling on the LASERTEC 65 3D, is an innovative generative machining method. It allows a faster production of complex geometries and individual 3D-parts. Especially large components up to √ò 500 mm can be produced cost-effectively with this hybrid solution. The flexible changeover between laser and milling operations enables the direct machining of areas that can no longer be reached later on the finished part. The laser process uses a metal powder feed, which allows the additive manufacture of parts without a processing chamber nor the need for a supporting structures. The additive process is up to 10 times faster than the generation in a powder bed. DMG MORI is offering the complete process chain, starting with the NC-programming in the hybrid CAD / CAM system, via the usage of proven technology parameters coming from a material data base, through to machining operations, process monitoring and documentation.",manufacturing

MANUFACURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT:Raw Materials: The raw materials required for cement manufacture are. Lime stone which provides calcium. Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

-edPLSlZScI,Gov't announces plans to boost manufacturing sector,"ÏÇ∞ÏóÖÎ∂Ä, Ï†úÏ°∞ÏóÖ Î•¥ÎÑ§ÏÉÅÏä§ ÎπÑÏ†Ñ Î∞è Ï†ÑÎûµ Î∞úÌëú

The trade ministry has announced greater details on measures to revitalize the country's manufacturing sector.
All part of efforts to transform South Korea into the world's fourth-largest exporter. 
Kim Hyesung outlines what the plan involves.  
Restructuring existing industries, finding new growth engines, nurturing talent and attracting more investment.
That's the government's plan to boost its manufacturing sector,... which accounts for nearly a third of the country's GDP,... but is hobbled by its stagnant automobile and shipbuilding industries,... and a lack of new businesses to drive future growth. 
The government's goal is to raise the proportion of value-added industries in manufacturing... from the current 25 percent... to the OECD average of around 30 percent. 
To nurture new industries and develop new products,... the government will push for structural changes... by introducing more smart factories, as well as AI and robots. 
In particular, the government will invest over seven billion US dollars in three new industries... including future cars, non-memory chips, and biotech. 
""To push for qualitative growth in manufacturing amid fiercer global competition, government support and investment is important. But with convergence between manufacturing, services and IT becoming the new trend in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, easing regulations in Korea is actually more important to boost innovation.""
In fact, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry's poll on 500 local manufacturing firms Tuesday... shows that two out of three surveyed... haven't found new businesses to drive sustainable future growth.
They are also losing competitiveness,... caught in between firms from advanced countries and emerging economies. 
The trade ministry said it will develop a detailed plan to boost the country's manufacturing sector,... by nurturing talent in engineering and manufacturing,... and providing tax incentives as well as financial support... for startups and mid-sized firms.

Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Manufacturing

Publicado em 12 de fev de 2017
The F-35 production process has been called an orchestra where time-tested manufacturing principles, next generation tooling techniques and a highly skilled workforce perform together to produce unmatched capabilities for American and allied forces.

More than 300,000 individual parts all come together to produce the F-35 Lightning II at Lockheed Martin's mile+-long factory in Fort Worth, Texas. In addition, final assembly and checkout is performed at facilities in Cameri, Italy and Nagoya, Japan.

The F-35 program brings together the world‚Äôs most experienced aerospace industry leaders, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and Pratt and Whitney. The global team also includes more than 1,400 suppliers from domestic and international companies around the world. This landmark project combines team expertise with sophisticated manufacturing, engineering and technological capabilities.

The F-35 production strategy is based on flow-to-takt manufacturing implementation. Flow-to-takt is the movement of component assemblies, like wings and forward fuselages, from one build station to the next at a rate equal to the delivery rate. This production rhythm increases efficiencies, lowers costs and reduces span times while synchronizing the delivery of parts, timing of tasks and positioning of personnel to achieve standard work in each line position.

The F-35 production strategy is already paying tremendous dividends. Production learning curves are beating legacy aircraft like the F-16. Costs have come down 57 percent since the procurement of the first production aircraft, and the time it takes to build the F-35 has been reduced by nearly half. As the F-35 prepares to enter full rate production, these key manufacturing indicators are projected to continue to improve.

0GbNwKmHaE,MANUFACTURING GUILT - A Short Film About Mumia Abu-Jamal's Case,"""Wow, masterful work! This piece broaches new ground in a number of areas... It is easily absorbed by the uninitiated and illuminating.""-- Linn Washington, Journalist, Philadelphia Tribune

MANUFACTURING GUILT is a short film that appears as a Bonus Feature on our dvd MUMIA: LONG DISTANCE REVOLUTIONARY (www.firstrunfeatures.com/mumiadvd.html).  The short takes on the colossus of Abu-Jamal's contentious case, distilling a mountain of evidence and years of oft-repeated falsehoods to the most fundamental elements of police and prosecutorial misconduct that illustrate a clear and conscious effort to frame Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of patrolman Daniel Faulkner. 

Based on the actual record of investigations and court filings from 1995 to 2003 - evidence denied by the courts and ignored in the press - MANUFACTURING GUILT cuts through the years of absurdities and overt racism to produce a clear picture of how Abu-Jamal's guilt was manufactured and his innocence suppressed beginning only moments after he and Faulkner were found shot in the early morning hours of December 9th, 1981. This historic and courageous film is the perfect companion to Long Distance Revolutionary - a film that is unequivocal in its force regarding Abu-Jamal's innocence.

""A chilling and vital inside view."" --Jamal Hart (Mumia's eldest son)

""Excellent and concise piece of film journalism""--Trust Movies

""Terrific! Focuses on the actual crime, with lots of specific information, going point by point over everything that is known, including a journalist's photos of the crime scene (those are amazing, by the way)... all of the questions I had (about the case) are answered in the short. So be sure to watch.""--Pop Culture Beast

ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,"Let‚Äôs tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing ‚Äì planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.

Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).

Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants‚Äô production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization ‚Äì from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.

------

Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it‚Äôs still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It‚Äôs one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that‚Äôs a blog for another day.

John Kutsch of Thorium Energy Alliance and Jim Kennedy of ThREE Consulting review the hazards maintaining U.S. current thorium policy. Heavy Rare Earth Element mining is impeded. Energy sector innovation is stifled. Thorium is less dangerous, less radioactive, and less easily metabolized than many elements we are exposed to on a daily basis.

Current regulation assists China's capture of high-tech manufacturing sector. Current regulation protects incumbent U.S. [light] rare earth producers who DISPOSE of thorium and valuable heavy rare earths in tailing ponds. Current regulation does NOT facilitate growth of U.S. economy.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle recognize reform is needed. No one is willing to introduce legislation to address the thorium problem. China continues to capture high-tech manufacturing jobs. U.S. private corporations are unable to pursue thorium an an energy resource.

THE THORIUM PROBLEM was delivered at SME - Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration on Feb 20th 2012 [2012-02-20] in Seattle.",manufacturing

ga5C6KvnKd0,The Big Picture - New Govt's Thrust on Manufacturing,"Manufacturing in 2017 contributedonly about 16% to India‚Äôs GDP, stagnating since economic reforms began in 1991. By contrast, in east and south-east Asia, the industry share has exceeded 30-40% while manufacturing is up 20-30%. India‚Äôs manufacturing share of GDP has not moved up at all, though between 2004 and 2012 manufacturing employment growth was reasonable. However, total manufacturing employment has fallen significantly between 2011 and 2016 by 10 million in just four years, especially in labour-intensive manufactures. This is the opposite of what was achieved in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. By contrast, in India the labour intensive manufacturing sectors like food processing, tobacco, textiles, apparel, leather, wood and furniture have seen a decline since 2012. On this edition of the big picture we will analyse what the focus of the new government should be on manufacturing. Joining

The shoe progresses from ""clicking"" or cutting of the leather components, through ""closing"" or stitching and fitting of the various components to make the upper.  The upper is then ""lasted"", a sole is directly injection moulded onto the upper and finally shoe roomed, inspected and boxed.

Unlike many fully automatic manufacturing processes, shoe making is still very labour intensive and involves a great many manual steps.

This session will examine the evolution of those disciplines from DARPA‚Äôs creation of the field of material sciences in late 1960‚Äôs, and the parallel evolution of information-driven advances in engineering and manufacturing. Together, these broad arcs span scales from nanomaterials to weapon systems, and continue to transform processes at every level in the industrial base. The result has been steady progress to today‚Äôs Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), Model Based Engineering, and Digital Manufacturing practices, and to the convergence of important trends in all three. Remarks by panelists and a facilitated discussion with the audience explore needs and opportunities for further advancements and for potential DARPA focus areas that could benefit DoD and the industrial base for years to come.

IZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

Manufacturing Day‚Ñ† is a celebration of modern manufacturing meant to inspire the next generation of manufacturers. Although Manufacturing Day officially occurs on the first Friday in October‚Äîthis year is October 2, 2015‚Äîany day can be a Manufacturing Day.

MFG DAY addresses common misperceptions about manufacturing by giving manufacturers an opportunity to open their doors and show, in a coordinated effort, what manufacturing is ‚Äî and what it isn‚Äôt. By working together during and after MFG DAY, manufacturers will begin to address the skilled labor shortage they face, connect with future generations, take charge of the public image of manufacturing, and ensure the ongoing prosperity of the whole industry. Supported by a group of industry sponsors and co¬≠producers, MFG DAY is designed to amplify the voice of individual manufacturers and coordinate a collective chorus of manufacturers with common concerns and challenges. The rallying point for a growing mass movement, MFG DAY empowers manufacturers to come together to address their collective challenges so they can help their communities and future generations thrive.

Part 3 of 12  Manufacturing is a key supply chain function, but one that many students find a bit intimidating.  This episode tries to demystify manufacturing by looking at manufacturing plants that are probably just down the street.  What is the tie between research and development, product design, manufacturing, and procurement?  What about outsourcing manufacturing?  What do modern operations and manufacturing managers need to consider?

This is the 3rd installment in Arizona State University's twelve-part introduction to supply chain management video series developed by Eddie Davila, Jeff Hough, Randy Cates, Dawn Feldman, Dan Ichikawa, Ian Schmoel, and Matt Hardy.  ASU, the W. P.

TjqRJZswl-U,Exclusive tour of LG's OLED R&D and manufacturing facilites in South Korea,"Check out our CES 2019 coverage! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...

LG brought Digital Trends along on an exclusive tour of several of its labs and factories halfway around the globe in Seoul, South Korea -- and we‚Äôre bringing you inside with us.

Make no mistake: Much of what we saw was confidential information, of the ‚ÄúI could tell you but I‚Äôd have to kill you‚Äù sort. But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.

The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth, called P9, is currently under construction. When completed, it will be the world‚Äôs largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17,000 people work at Paju, many living in enormous residential complexes on site. 

We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility, where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn‚Äôt require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly, assembly lines are designed to be modular. 

The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009, and over 3000 people work there, giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such, it‚Äôs one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops, signing non-disclosure forms, and so on. Indeed, we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.

President Moon Jae-in unveiled his plans to transform the local manufacturing sector... as part of his economic revitalization strategy.
He highlighted, the importance of cultivating future growth engines.
For details let's turn to our Shin Se-min.  
President Moon Jae-in shared his aspirations of reviving the country's manufacturing sector,... deemed the traditional pillars of Korea's economy.
""The revival of the manufacturing sector is the revival of the economy. By Korea becoming a top-four manufacturing power, we will open a new era where per capita income hits 40-thousand U.S. dollars.""  
The president announced his strategy dubbed ""Manufacturing Renaissance Vision"" at an event held at the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Center in Ansan,... south of Seoul. 
His plan also includes South Korea becoming the world's fourth-largest manufacturing power by the year 2030,... and pulling the economy out of its low-growth track.
It also aims to boost the country's exports to the world's top-four,.. currently in 6th place,... and expand the number of global exporting firms to 12-hundred,... more than double from the current 570.
The president expressed concerns however,... over the lack of new industries to lead future growth.
Compounded by structural issues like the fall in the working-age population and the slowing global economy,... he said the industry will only face further economic headwinds.
""Our manufacturing industry is at a grave crossroads, a leap or stagnation. We are at a pressing moment where we need to transition to an innovative and leading industrial structure.""
By breaking away from the long-established strategy of the past,... the President added that the country will undergo an industrial paradigm shift,... highlighted by the keywords... 'smart', 'eco-friendly' and 'fusion'.
The government said it plans to invest some 7-point-1 billion dollars in non-memory chip, bio-health and future cars  the administration's new growth engines,... on top of 152 billion dollars worth of private sector investments.
He also revealed that a joint private and public coordination body will be established,... chaired by the President himself to discuss various issues,... like production cost, labor and management conflicts.

Good manufacturing practices (GMP) are the practices required in order to conform to the guidelines recommended by agencies that control authorization and licensing for manufacture and sale of food, drug products, and active pharmaceutical products. These guidelines provide minimum requirements that a pharmaceutical or a food product manufacturer must meet to assure that the products are of high quality and do not pose any risk to the consumer or public.

Good manufacturing practices, along with good agricultural practices, good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, are overseen by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and other countries.

Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance in order to ensure that a food or drug product is safe for human consumption. Many countries have legislated that food and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers follow GMP procedures and create their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation.

All guidelines follow a few basic principles:

Manufacturing facilities must maintain a clean and hygienic manufacturing area.
Controlled environmental conditions in order to prevent cross contamination of food or drug product from adulterants that may render the product unsafe for human consumption.
Manufacturing processes are clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications.
Manufacturing processes are controlled, and any changes to the process are evaluated. Changes that affect the quality of the drug are validated as necessary.
Instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language. (Good Documentation Practices)
Operators are trained to carry out and document procedures.
Cross contamination with unlabelled major allergens is prevented.
Records are made, manually or by instruments, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the food or drug was as expected. Deviations are investigated and documented.
Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and accessible form.
The distribution of the food or drugs minimizes any risk to their quality.
A system is available for recalling any batch from sale or supply.
Complaints about marketed products are examined, the causes of quality defects are investigated, and appropriate measures are taken with respect to the defective products and to prevent recurrence.
Practices are recommended with the goal of safeguarding the health of consumers and patients as well as producing good quality food, medicine, medical devices, or active pharmaceutical products. In the United States, a food or drug may be deemed ""adulterated"" if it has passed all of the specifications tests, but is found to be manufactured in a facility or condition which violates or does not comply with current good manufacturing guideline. Therefore, complying with GMP is mandatory in all pharmaceutical manufacturing, and most food processing....",manufacturing

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.

PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.

Improved Time Management

Operators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.

Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!

Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!

Increasing Operator Productivity

An example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.

The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.

Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.

System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.

Improved Motivation

Staff motivation can be improved in two ways.

Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.

Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",manufacturing
GEgaV0aFBsg,Solar Cell Manufacturing with Heterojunction Technology,"The heterojunction technology combines the advantages of crystalline silicon solar cells and thin film technologies enabling solar cell to reach higher degrees of efficiency at a lower cost of production.

This movie shows you the process of manufacturing solar cells with heterojunction technology:

Texturing
For high efficiency HJT cells, damages from cutting have to be completely removed and a special texture created by wet chemical processes. The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.

PECVD Coating
The surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination, thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.

PVD Coating
A sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.

Printing
Screen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.

Curing
Curing printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.


Testing & Sorting
Meyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400‚Äì600 ms.",manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.

Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.

X813AkGuPDE,Automating Visual Inspections in Energy and Manufacturing with AI (Cloud Next '19),"AES is a Fortune 500 global power company, generating and distributing sustainable energy in 15 countries, owning and managing $33 billion in assets. To optimally serve their mission of accelerating a safer, greener, energy future, AES has rigorously scaled the use of drone technologies and machine learning in their wind farm operations. Using Google‚Äôs AutoML Vision, they can help automate the detection of defects, and prioritize maintenance of their high-value assets.

LG CNS is a global IT services company with USD$2.7 billion in annual sales. They supply IT solutions for the LG Group's affiliates and other companies, and apply big data and AI to improve manufacturing processes at scale. Originally, many inspectors were required to detect defects in everything from LCD and OLED panels, to optical films and automotive fabrics. But the monotony of visual inspections led to many errors, so LG CNS built their own in-house AI solution to visually inspect products on the assembly line. This required lots of time and effort to achieve high performing machine learning models, and they experienced a shortage of highly skilled AI experts. They turned to Google's AutoML Vision Edge to design and distribute models to the edge, and centrally control the performance of their deployed models in one integrated system. This improved accuracy and performance, and reduced the time it takes to build high quality models.

In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and other complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes.  Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals.  This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate.   Through the use of UAM technology, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with much less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.",manufacturing

Interested in taking advantage of predictive analytics within your local ControlLogix rack? Jonathan Wise ‚Äì Platform Leader for Embedded Analytics ‚Äì jumps on Manufacturing Happy Hour today to discuss how you can accomplish that with FactoryTalk Analytics LogixAI.

LogixAI is an artificial intelligence solution for ControlLogix that learns from the control program and builds a mathematical model to provide predictive analytics within your operation. This is different from traditional machine learning cases where data would be exported to a data center or the cloud to be tested and analyzed, then moved back into the control program to retrain it. LogixAI, on the other hand, simply works with the data coming across the PLC backplane, learns while the control program is running, then puts the results back into the controller.

Jonathan takes us through two different industry scenarios where LogixAI is highly applicable: 

1.) Anomaly Detection ‚Äì learning what‚Äôs normal to predict an abnormal condition (such as a food quality issue) 

2.) Virtual Sensing ‚Äì using data that exists to estimate data that doesn‚Äôt exist (like a dulling knife blade)

Make sure to follow the link to Rockwell‚Äôs Embedded Analytics page to learn more or reach out to your Rockwell Automation representative. Stay Innovative, Stay Thirsty.

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

VeLsJtId_g,MANUFACTURE OF THE BOFORS 40mm ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN AT CHRYSLER BOFORS GUN TEAM 58844,"Support Our Channel : https://www.patreon.com/PeriscopeFilm

Made as part of the WWII war effort by Chrysler, THE BOFORS GUN TEAM shows the manufacture of the Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun then in use by the Navy and Army. This was one of the most stunning manufacturing feats of the war, since the Bofors was an extremely intimidating weapon to mass produce and many believed it could not be produced in quantity, in time to make a difference in the war. Within 3 years however Chrysler had shipped over 40,000 complete mechanisms and 75,000 barrels. 

At , the Swedish-designed gun is seen in its ""Americanized"" configuration -- made for mass production in a Chrysler factory. At , new blueprints are made from Swedish originals which were in metric measure. At , a diagram shows how the manufacture of the gun was split between Dodge, DeSoto, Plymouth and other Chrysler plants. Production lines are seen for breech casings and other parts in the gigantic plants, which were formerly used for automobile manufacture. At , blocks are shown being made through mass production techniques. At , quality inspection is made of the blocks. At , the manufacture of the gun barrel is seen. At , breech blocks are assembled and tested. 

The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun,is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War.

In the post-war era the original design was not suitable for action against jet powered aircraft, so Bofors introduced a new model of significantly more power, the 40 mm L/70. In spite of sharing almost nothing with the original design other than the calibre and the distinctive conical flash hider, this weapon is also widely known simply as ""the Bofors"". Although not as popular as the original L/60 model, the L/70 remains in service, especially as a multi-purpose weapon for light armored vehicles, as on the CV 90. 
 
In order to supply both the Army and Navy with much greater numbers of the guns, Chrysler built 60,000 of the guns and 120,000 barrels through the war, at half the original projected cost, and filling the Army's needs by 1943. Over the lifetime of the production, their engineers introduced numerous additional changes to improve mass production, eventually reducing the overall time needed to build a gun by half; most of these changes were in production methods rather than the design of the gun itself.York Safe & Lock also produced the weapons, though its attempts to coordinate drawings across the program were unsuccessful, and this responsibility was transferred to the Naval Gun Factory in July 1943.There were many difficulties in producing the guns within the United States, beyond their complexity (illustrated by the use of 2,000 subcontractors in 330 cities and 12 Chrysler factories to make and assemble the parts).

DIL_OOF5FF,Silicon Manufacturing & The Perfect Wafer | Inside the Fab | Intel,"Meet Dave Pivin, a Failure Analyst Engineer at Intel whose job it is to continuously push towards the production of a perfect silicon wafer. As Dave puts it, it's like ""Looking in a million haystacks for a single needle"". 
 
 As silicon wafer production moves smaller and smaller, from 22 nanometer to 14 nanometer, imperfections in production are tough to see even with high-powered microscopes. Dave and his team of fellow scientists are charged with identifying the causes of these nearly invisible defects. 
 
 Check out Dave's story, and stay tuned for more stories ""Inside the Fab"" at Intel. Subscribe now to Intel on YouTube:

04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?

Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.

Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.

Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.

Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. 

So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.

Anything, anywhere

In the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.

Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it‚Äôs not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.

H03o2WCBoDU,The real reason manufacturing jobs are disappearing | Augie Picado,"We've heard a lot of rhetoric lately suggesting that countries like the US are losing valuable manufacturing jobs to lower-cost markets like China, Mexico and Vietnam -- and that protectionism is the best way forward. But those jobs haven't disappeared for the reasons you may think, says border and logistics specialist Augie Picado. He gives us a reality check about what global trade really looks like and how shared production and open borders help us make higher quality products at lower costs.

EJGSfvM2I8,"Manufacturer Price Sheet: Material, Labor, Overhead & Profit","The following video breaks down how a manufacturer should come up with a price for industrial finished goods. First, the company must account for its material costs and apply a 5 percent indirect cost to that portion of the manufacturer's price sheet.

This 5 percent is meant to offset overruns in production and or additional costs of financing inventory and material purchases.

Second, the company must account for its labor relative to each operation performed to turn a raw material into a finished good. The calculation involves defining the operation and applying the labor cost to both the setup time in manufacturing and the actual run time. 

Third, all labor costs are added in order to come up with a complete total for all the costs of manufacturing a given product. Those costs are then followed up by the company's overhead, which is calculated by taking its indirect expenses divided by its direct expenses. Indirect expenses are those expenses that are in addition to the the costs needed to produce a part. Direct expenses are exactly that. These include the costs involved or expenses involved in manufacturing the part. 

Finally, the company adds its mark-up in order to secure a profit on the sale. Profit is critical because it helps to fund the company's pursuit of new product introductions and secure its long-term future. 

Here is a sample of the Manufacturer Price Sheet in Excel Format

The facility produces a variety of nutritional products, including powders, such as the flagship Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix; liquids, such as the Herbal Aloe Concentrate; and teas, such as Herbal Tea Concentrate. Products manufactured at HIM Winston-Salem will be distributed in the United States and exported to more than 50 countries around the world.  Since announcing the Triad location in December 2012, Herbalife has invested more than $100 million to convert the over 800,000 square foot site to meet its exacting specifications. 
 
The retro-fit of the building ensures it is in full compliance with U.S. Good Manufacturing Practices for dietary supplements, acidified foods and food products. Within months of its operational start-up, the facility received NSF accreditation‚Äîa certification key to ensuring that products manufactured in Winston Salem meet strict standards for public health protection -- and its quality control laboratory received the highly regarded ISO 17025 certification. The flagship facility for Herbalife, and one of the most advanced facilities in the nutrition industry as a whole, also houses Herbalife‚Äôs technical operations Center of Excellence, an R&D laboratory complex that ensures products are backed by the best nutrition science.

Herbalife will also locate its Global Technical Operations Center, as well as state-of-the-art quality and testing laboratories at the Winston-Salem location.
 
Facts: Currently approximately 350 employees; will employ more than 500 when facility reaches full production by the end of 2015. The 800,000 square-foot facility is one-mile around. Equivalent to 200 basketball courts or 16 football fields ‚Äì enough room for an entire Sunday of NFL games to be played simultaneously. Estimated to produce 150 million units per year‚Äîthat‚Äôs 600,000 per day. Green features include energy efficient diode lights and integral water purification system, which processes water to make it pH-neutral ahead of disposal. The company has also extended its innovative wellness program to its employees in Winston Salem, including the annual bio-metric health screening and wellness coaching along with a comprehensive fitness center that includes basketball courts and a nature trail. The company is active in the local community and supports a number of organizations, including the North Carolina Soccer Fusion youth soccer organization and local cycling club Team MS Herbalife.

In this video Stefan shows you step by step how to find wholesale suppliers and manufacturers to private label a product and sell on Amazon.

""This is a very important step of this process because once you found a product that you want to sell or a niche or an opportunity that you want to sell on Amazon that you already deemed as profitable that you can make money from then the supplier piece is the next most important part.

You want to make sure that you find suppliers that have good prices, that will give you a great quote, that you can negotiate with and build a great relationship with, that you can order a certain number of units from, maybe a product from China or the United States. 

I will be showing you exactly how to do that.""

Transcript:

P&G is a fast-moving consumer goods company. We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.

Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of the
delivering this manufacturing of the future. 

Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.

The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.

Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their hand
to improve their business results.

Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.

From our team rooms we went away from you know hard written
paper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.

One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.

It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.

The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.

Too often we provide a solution that is limited.

I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain. 
 
The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.",manufacturing

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,"Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual, writer, reporter, and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: 

Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column, ""Today and Tomorrow"".

Edward Louis Bernays (November 22, 1891 -- March 9, 1995), was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations."" He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.

He felt this manipulation was necessary in society, which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC, The Century of the Self, pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations, and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.

Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13, 1902 ‚Äî December 18, 1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987, Lasswell ""ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century."" At the time, Almond asserted that ""few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time."" Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality, social structure, and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques, content analysis, para-experimental techniques, and statistical measurement.

The Committee on Public Information, also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee, was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months, from April 13, 1917, to August 21, 1919, it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.",manufacturing

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",manufacturing

All glazing panes are tested and examined by hand for best quality assurance.
Special equipment is used to seal the panes together for an airtight unit.
The latest gas-filled technology fills the panes with Argon or Krypton gas for added energy-efficiency.
Thermal welding technology ensures new frames have a continuous seal to minimize air and moisture transfer.
Windows are tested and examined before they leave the warehouse to ensure they meet stringent CSA standards.

A 5 axis laser metal deposition manufacturing method is being developed by TWI for an EU-funded project which is demonstrating  drastic time reduction in the manufacture of aero engine casings.

In LMD, a weld track is formed using metal powder as a filler material which is fed, through a coaxial nozzle, to a melt pool created by a focused high-power laser beam. By traversing both the nozzle and laser, a new material layer develops with precise accuracy and user-defined properties. The application of multi-layering techniques allows 3D structures to be created.",manufacturing

Marketing is as important as having a good product, they have to first attract customers to have a chance to sell the product to them.

-bDtCwNo-,Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing,"Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. 

Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.

This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.

A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",manufacturing

B8Pkp7OhwPg,"Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com 

The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.

The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.

The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.

Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. 

Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

f-tQYcZGM4,Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".

""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""

Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.

Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.

For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.

The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.

In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.

In that way, the book continues to resonate.

But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?

We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.

The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".

""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""

Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?

""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""

Aman Sethi put it like this:

""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""

3qXgmrGBn,The Automated Composite Manufacturing Pilot Plant,"The ‚ÄòAutomated Composite Manufacturing Pilot Plant‚Äô is widely regarded as a key step in developing expert knowledge of composites in the Netherlands. Composites are increasing replacing steel or aluminium parts in the aviation industry; moreover, composites are often stronger, more sustainable, less expensive, and capable of being applied in a wide variety of areas.

The ACM Pilot Plant allows further robotification of the production of composite landing gear components. In a wider context, the plant will focus on producing composites reinforced with industrial resins, for which the plant is outfitted with ultra-modern equipment, including one of the largest robotic composite fibre braiding machines in Europe.

The ACM Pilot Plant is open to companies that want to produce their composites on a large scale, including to companies that are active outside the aviation sector. The unique knowledge and facilities available in Marknesse are ideally suited for developing the most (cost-) efficient manufacturing methods. It is often precisely this last step ‚Äì between a prototype and launching the product ‚Äì that proves so difficult in bringing innovations to market.

This new facility derives from a Public-Private Partnership between Fokker Landing Gear and the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR), in close collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the province of Flevoland and the Noordoostpolder municipality. This Pilot Plant is the embodiment of the ‚Äògolden triangle‚Äô between government, industry and knowledge institutions. The ACM Pilot Plant is part of Smart Industry Fieldlab Flexible Manufacturing‚Äô, for which plans for further development are currently being devised.",manufacturing

7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  



From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

A worm drive is a gear arrangement in which a worm (which is a gear in the form of a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.

Like other gear arrangements, a worm drive can reduce rotational speed or transmit higher torque. A worm is an example of a screw, one of the six simple machines.

One of the major advantages of worm gear drive units are that they can transfer motion in 90 degrees.
A gearbox designed using a worm and worm-wheel is considerably smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90¬∞ to each other. With a single start worm, for each 360¬∞ turn of the worm, the worm-wheel advances only one tooth of the gear wheel. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the ""size of the worm wheel - to - 1"". Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm wheel reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear to achieve the same 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.
There are three different types of gears that can be used in a worm drive.

The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, machined around the circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.[1]

An enveloping (hourglass) worm has one or more teeth and increases in diameter from its middle portion toward both ends.[2]

Double-enveloping wormgearing comprises enveloping worms mated with fully enveloping wormgears. It is also known as globoidal wormgearing. technology information technology news technology in education technology future technology innovation technology solutions bearing machinery cnc",manufacturing
N-HoLI9hO0,Top 10 3D-Printed Cars - the Future of Auto Manufacturing,"3d printing is one of those disruptive technologies that might reshape our future. It is cheap, it is fast and environmentally friendly.

Light cocoon ‚Äì Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
The German engineering company EDAG is quite ambitious to say the least, as it is set on changing the way cars are being built today. Light Cocoon is a follow up to the Genesis that was this company‚Äôs first attempts to create a 3d printed Auto body. The outer shell of the Cocoon is made of durable water resistant ultra thin fabric that is drawn over the 3d printed body made of polymer. The outfit for this car was designed in cooperation with the famous German manufacturer of sport clothes jack Wolfskin. 

Soulmate ‚Äì Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
Soulmate is the latest development from Edag that was introduced in 2016. This car concept was designed in cooperation with the German company Bosch, and resulted in the creation of incredibly beautiful lightweight car with features of connected mobility. The outer shell of Soulmate reminds us about the earlier prototype of the company ‚Äì Light Cocoon. 

Strati - Local Motors: localmotors.com/strati/
This is the world‚Äôs first 3d printed electric car. Strati was created as a partnership project between Local motors and Oak Ridge National Lab. It took 44 hours to print this car and it consists from roughly 227 layers and 50 main parts, which is much less in comparison to 6,000 parts of traditional autos. Fully recyclable black ABS plastic reinforced with carbon fibers was used as the building material for Strati and the only not printed parts are the motor, battery, power train, tires and wheels. 

LM 3d Swim - Local Motors: launchforth.io/localmotors/road-ready-3d-printed-car/explore/
LM3D is a street legal 4 seater, which parts are 75% printed by the use of Big Area additive manufacturing technology. This model is made from a blend of 80% recyclable ABS plastic and 20% carbon fiber., however Local Motors are trying to test new compounds in order to create a viable manufacturing process to print 90% of a car. 

Blade - Divergent3D: www.divergent3d.com/
The Blade is the first supercar in the world to be built by the use of a 3d printing technology. This auto was build by the use of a patented Node technology, when 3d printed aluminum parts connect carbon fiber tubes, to enhance durability of the chassis. 

Lotus 340r ‚Äì 3D replica: www.buildparts.com/idea-center/lotus
But companies like C.ideas is using 3d scanning and printing technologies to give new lives to limited edition autos like 1999 Lotus 340r. More than 40 components were produced for this four wheeler that came out in a very small volume of 340.

YkO52UqWyE,How Political Power Uses Propaganda to Distract the Public: Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent,"Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by US academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr.

Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky's five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman's propaganda model to a variety of new situations. The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.

As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's ""necessary illusions"" and the ""noble lies"" of Leo Strauss, ""public relations"" of Edward Bernays and ""myth making"" of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. Likewise, Chomsky's analyses in Necessary Illusions represent a refocus on the use of these patterns of power, which he implies to underscore the failure of populations - particularly in a representative democracy - to learn from history in this regard.

Transcript:

Save time and money on the production of large-scale, high-value metal (titanium, tantalum, inconel, stainless steel, etc.) parts and prototypes with Sciaky's Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM‚Ñ¢) solution.

Transcript:

Imagine: From this, to this, in a fraction of the time and cost it used to take. With Sciaky‚Äôs exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing, or EBAM‚Ñ¢ for short, metal 3D printing is not limited by part size, material, or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length, 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet in diameter, made from virtually any metal, including inconel and stainless steels, and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  

How does the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program, Sciaky‚Äôs fully-articulated, moving electron beam gun deposits metal, from wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour, which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition, a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM‚Ñ¢ process to increase deposition efficiency, as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. 

So, whether you need to produce a functional prototype, or a run of production parts, the possibilities are virtually endless. 

Our technology partners include the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, Boeing, DARPA, Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.

Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing ‚Äì can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.

PnDQHZr8,Manufacture of cowbells,"UNESCO: List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding - 2015
URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/USL...
Description: The Portuguese cowbell is a traditional idiophone percussion instrument that provides an unmistakable soundscape in rural areas. Alc√°√ßovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells, traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock, are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods, cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.

Grob's business jet 'SPn', the first carbon fiber passenger plane, is just about to be released on the market. The new passenger jet will be much more economical with fuel and much more stable than its competitors. The 8-seat plane costs 5 point 9 million euros. And 80 firm customers are already waiting.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",history

Immense and precise, the pyramids remain among mankind's greatest accomplishments, and experts still debate how they were built. Span the globe in this riveting look at the most incredible accomplishments of the ancient world achievements that rival and even surpass those of today. From the secret formula of Damascus steel which helped drive the Crusaders from the Holy Land to the """"computer"""" from Ancient Greece, probe the origins of these incredible inventions. Take to the skies in a balloon made from a design 1,000 years old, and join scientists, engineers and historians as they probe the mysteries of ancient devices that cannot be replicated today! And examine the extraordinary innovations of Leonardo Da Vinci, whose drawings included designs for a tank, machine, gun, helicopter and parachute!""",history

This is India! Just look how beautiful, magical and spiritual this place is. Green trees, deep blue rivers, hot shining sun‚Ä¶ India. Are you ready to travel back in time again? Buckle up because it‚Äôs going to be a long rough ride! 

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

MQcJ0d5yxCU,80 HISTORICAL PHOTOS YOU MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE,"With decades gone by after historic events have passed, we often think we‚Äôve seen those events from every angle possible. On occasion though, new images surface long after the photo was snapped that show historical moments in a whole new light.

The following images are so rare, it‚Äôs incredible we are able to see them today at all. Get ready to take a look at history in a new way that seems almost unbelievable!",history
HyjLt_RGE,The History of Writing - Where the Story Begins - Extra History,"How did the ancient civilization of Sumer first develop the concept of the written word? It all began with simple warehouse tallies in the temples, but as the scribes sought more simple ways to record information, those tallies gradually evolved from pictograms into cuneiform text which could be used to convey complex, abstract, or even lyrical ideas.

____________

Sumer was the land of the first real cities, and those cities required complex administration. The temples which kept people together were not only religious places, but also warehouses which stored the community's collective wealth until it was needed to get through lean years. As the donations came in, scribes would count the items and draw pictures of them on clay tablets. The images quickly became abstract as the scribes needed to rush, and they also morphed to represent not just an image but the word itself - more specifically, the sound of the word, which meant that it could also be written to represent other words that sounded similar (homophones). Sumerian language often put words together to express new ideas, and the same concept applied to their writing. As people came to use this system more, the scribes began to write from left to right instead of top to bottom since they were less likely to mess up their clay tablets that way. Those who read the tablets didn't appreciate this change, so the scribes rotated the words 90 degrees allowing tablets to be rotated if the reader preferred - but this made the images even more abstract, until eventually the pictograms vanished entirely to be replaced by wedge-shaped stylus marks: cuneiform. Many of Sumer's neighbors adopted this invention and helped it spread throughout the region, though completely different writing systems developed independently in cultures situated in places like China and South America!

Our image of dinosaurs has been constantly changing since naturalists started studying them about 350 years ago. Taken together, these pictures can tell us a whole lot about just how much we have learned. Let's explore the history of dinosaur science as seen through the history of dinosaur art.

zQJwRIcUQ0,Rise of Evil ‚Äì Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party ‚Äì Sabaton History 020 [Official],"After the Great War, many different movements and parties tried to replace the by many despised Weimar Republic. One of them was the NSDAP, the National Socialist German Workers Party. Headed by Adolf Hitler, the NSDAP transformed Germany into a country that would once again bring war and destruction to Europe. The Sabaton Song ‚ÄòRise of Evil‚Äô is about Hitlers rise to power, and in this video we dive into the historical context behind the song.

Miller gives a little history lesson of the death camps the Nazis used to intentionally and carefully exterminate the Jews. AOC‚Äôs ignorant, inflammatory remarks are a disgrace. Then, in the age of moral relativism, we are told by progressives that everything goes. Their push to decriminalize sex work is another example of progressive policies that do more harm to women and children than good.

PeRba-dZj4,100 Largest Empires in History,"This video shows the 100 largest empires in History.

Empires are defined as ‚Äúany relatively large sovereign political entity whose components are not sovereign‚Äù

Data is mostly based on: 
Rein Taagepera  (1979). Size and Duration of Empires: Growth-Decline Curves, 600 B.C. to 600 A.D. Social Science History. Vol. 3, No. 3/4 (1979), pp. 115-138



I updated Rein Taagepera‚Äòs list because : 
- I drew the shapes of the countries on Google map and sometimes found different results from Taagepera's
- I added some empires. For example, I added the United States in its XIXth century form, when it had a colonial empire consisting of the Philippines, Guam, Samoa, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama. I would not have classified the USA as an empire today.

You might notice that some empires look larger than others on the map, while being classified as smaller. That is because maps do not represent the actual size of a sphere like the earth.

5vw9vSTMBY,England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey Imprisoned | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"12th July 1553 was Lady Jane Grey's third day as Queen of England but Mary Tudor was already intending to do everything in her power to seize the crown. Historian Helen Castor explores how Mary's allegiance grew in size and also how Lady Jane started to lose the loyalty of the Privy Council, which led to her becoming a prisoner in the Tower of London.

In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.

This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.

The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.
Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.

Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.

When it comes to Western role-playing games, few video game developers are as renowned as Bioware. The Edmonton-based studio‚Äôs catalogue is as celebrated as it is influential, with almost all of its titles representing the peaks of their genres in the eras they debuted. Baldur‚Äôs Gate brought computer RPGs back in vogue with its sublime, high-fantasy gameplay. Neverwinter NightsKnights masterfully adapted its tenets into a multiplayer-centric experience. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic saw the former games‚Äô narrative finesse melded with the adventurism of the galaxy far, far away. And Mass Effect made all of this Bioware‚Äôs own ‚Äì while taking it to the next level.

 But being this renowned comes with a high heavy price. Today, gamers are well aware of the struggles the studio dealt with recently during the development of games like Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem. Yet the reality is that struggles like these have persisted throughout its entire history, with nearly every major production that Bioware has successfully completed representing a triumph in the face of massive adversity. 

 Dragon Age, Bioware‚Äôs much-beloved high-fantasy series, is perhaps most emblematic of this. While each of its mainline entries were made under vastly different circumstances from one another, they all suffered in their own, unique ways. Its third one‚Äôs design failed to fully come together until late in its production, and needed to be made in an incredibly unruly engine. Its second one‚Äôs development period was one of the most cramped its staff had ever experienced. And its first operated without a consistent team or set of tools for an immensely long ‚Äì so much so, that many wondered if it was ever going to come out at all.
 This is the history of Dragon Age: Origins.

6pxxS07PZn0,In Search Of History - Charles Ponzi & His Scheme (History Channel Documentary),"This episode was converted from an old VHS tape that had considerable wear and tear, resulting in poor audio quality. Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.
__________________________
Narrated by David Ackroyd

Charles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.

____________

With no written records from the Zulus themselves, historians and anthropologists have pieced together their history from a smattering of sources. We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.

HNfSBCygXTg,History of Russia Part 2,"Epic History TV's history of Russia continues! Emerging from the Time of Troubles, Russia fights back against foreign invaders, as Prince Pozharksy and Kuzma Minin liberate Moscow from Polish forces. Russia's assembly, the Zemsky Sobor, turns to a 16 year old boy, Mikhail Romanov, for leadership. He and the early Romanovs oversee a turbulent period of war, reform and rebellion: all Russian peasants are made serfs by the terms of the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, while Patriarch Nikon's religious reforms split the Russian Orthodox Church between Reformers and Old Believers. The Thirteen Years War (1654 ‚Äì 67) against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth brings Smolensk and Kiev under Russian control, as Cossack renegade (and folklore hero) Stenka Razin leads revolt in the south. 

In 1689, Peter the Great seizes power from his half-sister, Princess Regent Sofia. Peter is determined to make Russia a great European power, and travels to the Dutch Republic and England to study the latest developments in science and shipbuilding. He wages successful wars against the Ottoman Empire, acquiring the Black Sea port of Azov, and defeats Sweden in the Great Northern War, winning one of Russia's most famous victories at Poltava in 1709. He builds a new capital, St.Petersburg, as well as a Russian navy, and reforms education, industry and government. Not without internal opposition, Peter's boundless energy transforms Russia. 

The second half of Russia's 18th century is dominated by female rulers. Under the reign of Empress Anna Ioannovna, Vitus Bering charts the coast of Alaska and discovers the Aleutian Islands. Empress Elizabeth leads Russia into the Seven Years War against Frederick the Great, with Russian victory at Kunersdorf in 1759, and oversees construction of St.Petersburg's stunningly lavish and expensive Winter Palace. While Peter III falls victim to a conspiracy by his wife Catherine and army officers, leading to his own death, and the reign of Catherine the Great..

https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReport

BAKU - The core religious allegory of Islam starts with Muhammad‚Äôs revelations in the caves and ends with the death of the fourth successor Ali, almost forty years later. The allegory is analogous to the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ in Christianity. During Muhammad‚Äôs lifetime, his community gained control over the Arabian Peninsula. Though he passed away in 632, Islam‚Äôs story continued through his four closest followers: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, who together formed the Rashidun, or Rightly Guided One‚Äôs. Together, they established the first Islamic state, the Caliphate.

In just thirty years, the Rashidun Caliphate conquered all of Persia, Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Levant, and even parts of the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia. In some ways, this new state resembled a democracy. All four leaders were elected by council representatives. But the transition of power between these leaders was not straightforward.

As human beings do, the people of Europe were very busy traveling around to trade, to spread religion, and in a lot of cases to try and conquer other people. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans developed a bunch of tools and techniques that would allow them to travel around the world, in numbers and force heretofore unseen on the planet. And a lot of the results weren't great for the people who already lived in the places Europeans were ""visiting.""

dnV_MTFEGIY,The Atlantic Slave Trade: Crash Course World History #24,"In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. 

Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief, Boba Fett makes an appearance.

Band of Brothers is a 2001 American war drama miniseries based on historian Stephen E. Ambrose's 1992 non-fiction book of the same name. The executive producers were Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who had collaborated on the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan. The episodes first aired in 2001 on HBO. The series won Emmy and Golden Globe awards in 2001 for best miniseries.
The series dramatizes the history of ""Easy"" Company (part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) from jump training in the United States through its participation in major actions in Europe, and up until Japan's capitulation and war's end. The events portrayed are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took literary license, adapting the recorded history for the purposes of dramatic effect and series structure. All of the characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Some of the men were recorded in contemporary interviews, which viewers see as preludes to each episode. The men's identities are not revealed until the finale.
The title for the book and the series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by Henry V of England before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series' finale.",history

Oy1ghitwE,King Edward And Wallis Simpson: England's Most Famous Love Affair | Absolute History,"Rewriting the history of one England‚Äôs most famous love affairs.

Wallis Simpson found herself at the centre of a national scandal when she was seen to ensnare Edward VIII and lure him from the throne of England. But in this explosive film, biographer Anne Sebba sifts through a newly discovered cache of documents - shown in this film for the first time - that contains 15 secret letters written by Wallis Simpson herself around the time ofthe abdication. These extraordinary personal missives have the power to rewrite both history and our perception of Wallis. They reveal she was deeply in love with another man, and chart her fear, desperation and loneliness as she found herself becoming trapped into marrying the man who should have been king.

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an 'A' student, baby
I can win your love for me

DoIQdQ9Mo5E,Lady Jane Grey (England's Forgotten Queen) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Lady Jane Grey became a Tudor Queen after the dying King Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII left her the throne. Now, historian Helen Castor explores the tragic story of Lady Jane Grey and investigates how her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, was sealed as soon as she was drawn into the line of succession. 

In 1553 Tudor England, Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, leaves the throne, not to his elder sister, Mary, but to his cousin, the Lady Jane Grey.

This is a story of intrigue, conspiracy, political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman, ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace, who ends up losing her life as a result.

The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession, her terrible fate, on the block in the Tower of London, is sealed.
Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves, those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne, not as consort, but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth, confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane, well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.

Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her, tracing her world, and the nine days she spent on the throne.

Subscribe to American Eye 

10. Columbus Discovered America

9. Paul Revere

8. 13 Colonies

7. Washington Cherry Tree

6. The Crossing of the Delaware

5. Van Gogh Cut off Ear
While in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 

4. Sphinx Nose
How did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 

3. Vikings Horned Helmets
Archaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies

2. Stonehenge
One of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 

1. First Thanksgiving
Sorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",history

ZnZEoOJ-cxE,Japan in the Heian Period and Cultural History: Crash Course World History 227,"In which John Green teaches you about what westerners call the middle ages and the lives of the aristocracy...in Japan. The Heian period in Japan lasted from 794CE to 1185CE, and it was an interesting time in Japan. Rather than being known for a thriving economy, or particularly interesting politics, the most important things to come out of the Heian period were largely cultural. There was a flourishing of art and literature in the period, and a lot of that culture was created by women. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu was the classic piece of literature of the day, and it gave a detailed look into the way the Aristocrats of the Heian period lived. While this doesn't give a lot of insight into the lives of daily people, it can be very valuable, and the idea of approaching history from a cultural perspective is a refreshing change from the usual military or political history that survives from so many eras.

QZxpU,The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel,"Back when the internet was young and facts still had meaning, there was the History Channel, featuring shows about - you guessed it - history. But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.
Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.
But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.
Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.

kk5-ynRPf,A History of Britain - The Humans Arrive (1 Million BC - 8000 BC),"In this first episode we go back to the very beginning of human life of Britain.

Note: The exact identity of the human species found at Happisburgh is a little more up in the air than this video makes it sound. Currently academic consensus looks to be moving towards Homo antecessor as the correct identity, however the stone tools found at Pakefield and Boxgrove are almost certainly from Homo heidelbergensis. This was simplified to Homo heidelbergensis in the video for the sake of brevity. Homo heidelbergensis may also have been ambush predators on top of scavengers and fishers.

7VOMFjQfJ8,The Jesus of History versus the Christ of Faith,"Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history‚Äôs most influential and enigmatic figures by examining Jesus within the context of the times in which he lived: the age of zealotry. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against historical sources, Aslan describes a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity secret; and the seditious ‚ÄúKing of the Jews,‚Äù whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his lifetime. Aslan explores why the early Church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary and grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: ...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

kcl98aBRkD8,The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film,"Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it.
 This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",history

In which John Green teaches you about the economic malaise that beset the United States in the 1970s. A sort of perfect storm of events, it combined the continuing decline of America's manufacturing base and the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979, and brought about an stagnant economy, paired with high inflation. Economists with a flair for neologisms and portamenteau words called this ""stagflation,"" and it made people miserable. Two presidential administrations were scuttled at least in part by these economic woes; both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter are considered failed presidents for many reasons, but largely because of an inability to improve the economy. (hint: In reality, no one person can materially change something as big as the world economy, even if they are president, but one person sure can make a handy scapegoat!) So, by and large, the 70s were a pretty terrible time in America economically, but at least the decade gave us Mr. Green.

...and Grass: The History of Marijuana narrated by Woody Harrelson 

Magic Weed : The Truth About Cannabis Sativa traces the story of the Cannabis plant, which has been known to mankind for thousands of years and how it serves us in so many ways. The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul. Also explored in this documentary is the American relationship with hemp, including it‚Äôs ban during the 1920?s and the various uses of the hemp plant. 

Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes. Different parts of the plant have different uses, and different varieties are cultivated in different ways and harvested at different times, depending on the purpose for which it is grown. Cannabis or Ganja is associated with Shiva, who is popularly believed to like the hemp plant.",history

lJaltUmrG,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,"In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?

Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons ‚Äì there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, Neolithic farmers began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization. Today, the world produces roughly 22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. Paul Kindstedt shares the history of one of our oldest and most beloved foods.

NO_1fnR0g,Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History,"Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in History

Lesbian relationship isn‚Äôt something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.

10. Josephine Baker
Josephine Baker (1906 ‚Äì 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the ‚ÄúBlack Pearl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBronze Venus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreole Goddess.‚Äù She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many ‚Äúlady lovers.‚Äù

9. Frida Kahlo
Frida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 ‚Äì 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 

8. Amrita Sher-Gill
Amrita Sher-Gil (1913 ‚Äì1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.

7. Billie Jean King
Billie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.

6. Virginia Woolf
Adeline Virginia Woolf (1882 ‚Äì 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.

5. Audre Lorde
Audre Lorde (1934 ‚Äì 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a ‚Äúblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,‚Äù and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.

4. Barbara Gittings
Barbara Gittings (1932 ‚Äì 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.

3. Jane Addams
Jane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 ‚Äì 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.

2. Queen Christina of Sweden
Christina (1626 ‚Äì 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. 
Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.

1. Sappho
Sappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.

In this landmark 4-part series Waldemar argues that the Dark Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world‚Äôs most famous collections and discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually an ‚ÄòAge of Light'.

One of the (few) ways that many of us can relate to the vast scope of history is from the visual angle. Research-based reconstructions certainly bring forth such an advantage with their provision of ‚Äòglimpses‚Äô into the past. And among them, facial reconstructions of actual historical characters rather notch it up a level, with their ability to tantalizingly satisfy our inherent curiosity about the ‚Äòplayers‚Äô in the grander scheme of things.

Some 100 people, many of them seeking religious freedom in the New World, set sail from England on the Mayflower in September 1620. That November, the ship landed on the shores of Cape Cod, in present-day Massachusetts. A scouting party was sent out, and in late December the group landed at Plymouth Harbor, where they would form the first permanent settlement of Europeans in New England.

‚ÄúSociety takes the business of making money very seriously indeed. Much of our education system is geared towards giving people the skills to get a good job and a steady income. 

By contrast, very little attention is given to how to spend money well ‚Äì by which we mean, in ways that stand a chance of properly increasing our sense of well-being and therefore justifying the sacrifices that went into earning the cash.

r161cLYzuDI,Where US Politics Came From: Crash Course US History #9,"In which John Green teaches you where American politicians come from. In the beginning, soon after the US constitution was adopted, politics were pretty non-existent. George Washington was elected president with no opposition, everything was new and exciting, and everyone just got along. For several months. Then the contentious debate about the nature of the United States began, and it continues to this day. Washington and his lackey/handler Alexander Hamilton pursued an elitist program of federalism. They attempted to strengthen the central government, create a strong nation-state, and leave less of the governance to the states, They wanted to create debt, encourage manufacturing, and really modernize the new nation/ The opposition, creatively known as the anti-federalists, wanted to build some kind of agrarian pseudo-paradise where every (white) man could have his own farm, and live a free, self-reliant life. The founding father who epitomized this view was Thomas Jefferson. By the time Adams became president, the anti-federalists had gotten the memo about how alienating a name like anti-federalist can be. It's so much more appealing to voters if your party is for something rather than being defined by what you're against, you know? In any case, Jefferson and his acolytes changed their name to the Democratic-Republican Party, which covered a lot of bases, and proceeded to protest nearly everything Adams did. Lest you think this week is all boring politics,you'll be thrilled to hear this episode has a Whiskey Rebellion, a Quasi-War, anti-French sentiment, some controversial treaties, and something called the XYZ Affair, which sounds very exciting. Learn all about it this week with John Green.

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Much of America's politics came from debates between democratic republican Thomas Jefferson and federalist Alexander Hamilton: 
While Jefferson would go on to become president, Hamilton heavily influenced President George Washington who set many American political ideals in his farewell address that Hamilton helped craft:

He reflects on making history as he and his teammates bring the trophy back to Toronto, Canada for the first time in franchise history. He shares the advice he gives to his teammates, specifically in regards to the media attention that comes along with becoming a successful team, but he makes sure to stay humble when talking about his previous experience in the NBA Finals with the San Antonio Spurs and earning the 2014 NBA Finals MVP honors. Leonard is proud of the team that the Raptors have become, with ""no one butting heads"" to distract from the work on the hardwood and smiles as he talks about what it means to him to bring a trophy back to Jurassic Park and the fans in Toronto. He lastly touches upon free agency, saying he's taking it day-to-day and will take some time to enjoy the victory.

kcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...

It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.

In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.

The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:
The American Adventure (1975)
American Adventures (1987)
American History (1982)
The American Pageant (1991)
The American Tradition (1984)
The American Way (1979)
The Challenge of Freedom (1990)
Discovering American History (1974)
Land of Promise (1983)
Life and Liberty (1984)
Triumph of the American Nation (1986)
The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)
In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:
The American Journey (2000)
The American Pageant (2006)
The Americans (2007)
America: Pathways to the Present (2005)
A History of the United States (2005)
Holt American Nation (2003)

Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.
Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.

Jzl9Q3g35,PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires,"-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines, I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines, for it would be a monument of the richness of the country, to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people, and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstood

plus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines, if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. 

I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch:  ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! 
Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what, history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.

Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story,...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues, even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.

This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.

The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires, Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education. Buried by the destructive sands of time and Sunken by the war waging seas of fate, lies a paradise of melting cultures, The Pearl of the Orient.

P.S. It's time for Fiilipino's to trace back history and use it! and give it a priority!!
 From the time of Negritos, to the arrival of Austronesians to the Ming dynasty to the Arab and Indian era to Spanish and American Colonization, and to the World War 2 and so on! 
Filipino culture and History is very beautiful you only need to realize it.

Update: this is not a Chinese propaganda, this video does not claim that China originally owns Philippines including spratlys. watch the whole thing!

[Also Watch old Manila heritage story: Warsaw,Poland(the most damaged city in the world) did replicated it's old beauty and build their heritage structure authentically, so why not Manila? every other city in Metro Manila should be modern with tall skyscrapers like BGC, they're just new cities anyway! but The City of Manila is very very old with a lots of stories to tell, the city should be where we see a glimpse of beautiful past.]

Corrections:

1.  Beirut is in Lebanon, not Syria.

2.  At the time of the Roman Empire, Great Britain would have been known as Britannia rather than England.  The name ""England"" was first used during the Middle Ages, referring to the tribe of Germanic Angles that settled the island after the fall of the Roman Empire.

3.  Our Lady of Guadalupe is the only Marian apparition in the Americas to have been approved by the Holy See.  Other Marian apparitions in the Americas have been approved by local ordinaries, including Our Lady of Good Success in Ecuador (1572),  Our Lady of Good Help in Wisconsin (1859), Our Lady of Cuapa in Nicaragua (1980), in Venezuela (1984) and Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolas in Argentina (1980s).

4.  At , the correct spelling is ""Hugh O'Flaherty"", not ""O'Flattery""",history

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π', meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he called Ivan 'the Terrible' in this video? Because he was evil or useless? No, it is because '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English many years ago as 'Terrible', when the word commonly meant awesome or formidable (see definitions 3 & 4 here: ). And in English, Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

How evil must you be to use your position of power to oppress innocent people? Take Pope Alexander VI. This awful ‚Äúreligious‚Äù leader would use all sorts of schemes to rob people of their money rich and poor alike.  But that‚Äôs nothing compared to someone like Idi Amin who massacred around 300,000 civilians. Then there are those terrorist leaders like Osama Bin Laden who ordered the execution of 9/11 and ordered his own men to sacrifice themselves in order to kill innocent lives.

X0zudTQelzI,The Crusades - Pilgrimage or Holy War?: Crash Course World History #15,"In which John Green teaches you about the Crusades embarked upon by European Christians in the 12th and 13th centuries. Our traditional perception of the Crusades as European Colonization thinly veiled in religion isn't quite right. John covers the First through the Fourth Crusades, telling you which were successful, which were well-intentioned yet ultimately destructive, and which were just plain crazy. Before you ask, no, he doesn't cover the Children's Crusade, in which children were provoked to gather for a Crusade, and then promptly sold into slavery by the organizers of said Crusade. While this story is charming, it turns out to be complete and utter hooey.

In this masterful talk, he explains how the great speakers in history use 7 secrets and how we can all become a great speaker by following these secrets and by not just giving a ""speech"" but rather creating ""conversations"" from the heart.

Richard has dedicated himself to creating new paradigms in Public Speaking, Politics, and even our understanding of God

lTMOMiQACGU,Australia. History of Australia in a Nutshell.,"The animated history of Australia in a nutshell. For centuries, rumors and legends are spreading among the traders, about the Terra Australis Incognita, unknown southern land. For Europeans, this is only a tale. 

However, in the middle of the sixteenth century, a series of world maps are created, so-called 'the maps from Dieppe,' documenting the latest Portuguese explorations, on which a mysterious land is found, called 'Le Grand Java.'

A few centuries later, the map will be considered by some as the evidence of discovering Australia by Portuguese. 

Soon after, in sixteen-o-five a Dutch trader, Willem Janszoon, sets sails
from the Dutch East Indies to search for a new land. According to his plan, he arrives at an unknown destination and names it 'Keer-Weer.' As it turns out, later on, it is Australia, modern-day Cape York.

Since that moment, the sea route is frequented by the Dutch ships, which sometimes, sailing too far away are sighting the coast of Terra Australis. 

The Dutch, bring Terra Australis to the world maps.

In sixteen-eighty-eight, William Dampier sets out on a voyage around the New Holland, returns and convinces the Admiralty to support another expedition.

In August seventeen-sixty-eight, HMS Bark the Endeavor, under the command of Captain James Cook, sets sails from England.

In the year seventeen-seventy arrives at the coast of New Holland and disembarks in several spots, including Botany Bay and Possession Island and gives the land a name - the New South Wales. 

Cook's expedition spreads the idea to colonize the new land, and with losing the thirteen colonies, the idea grows stronger. 

During that time, many people in Britain live in poverty and the penalty for theft is high. Choosing between hunger, and thievery, many Brits are choosing the theft and simultaneously overpopulates the local prisons.

Officially to reduce the criminal population, and unofficially to make use of the human resources British Government sends out an expedition to create a penal colony and a bridgehead for further British colonization. 

In seventeen-eighty-eight under the patronage of Lord Sydney, an expedition arrives at Botany Bay under the command of Arthur Philip, carrying seven hundred and thirty convicts and two hundred and fifty free men plus the crew. 

Discovers a large bay, founds a settlement and names it after the patron of the expedition, Sydney. 

British push forward, and in eighteen-twenty-seven Edmund Lockyer founds Albany in modern-day Western Australia. Britain claims the entire continent.

Along the increase of the free people, resistance grows, people do not want the penal status of the land. Finally, the British Parliament convinced, agrees to stop sending convicts to some of the colonies. Since eighteen-forty sending criminals will be gradually reduced, until the tenth of January eighteen-sixty-eight when the last shipment of convicts will reach the Western Australia. 

In eighteen-twenty-five the population equals about sixty thousand people, to reach four hundred-fifty thousand in eighteen-fifty-one, to touch, during a gold rush, over a million and fifty thousand people, just ten years later.

Locally, Aborigines are oppressed.

At the beginning of colonization, Aborigines not knowing the concept of property, do no know what treaties with the Europeans can bring.
They are bringing disease and plagues decimating aborigines, and also the conquest of the natives pushed out from their homelands.

Until the nineteen-sixty-seven, Aborigines, will not be considered as equal inhabitants and citizens of their native land.

On the first of January nineteen-o-one, a dominion of the Commonwealth of Australia is proclaimed, and Sir Edmund Burton becomes the first prime minister of the federation. 

Along with the outbreak of the First World War, thousands of young people on a distant continent, are at war which they do not understand.

Thousands of dead and wounded shock Australian public opinion, and make them realize the difference between the British and Australian interests. 

The Second World War breaks out. Like two decades earlier, Australia joins war along with Britain. However, the British are being defeated in the far east. Japan quickly takes new territories. Hong Kong falls. Singapore falls. Australia is under threat. The United Kingdom put on the defensive in Europe and cannot provide support. 

A turning point occurs. ANZAC asks the United States for protection. Along with its victories, the US takes the opportunity to pull Australia and New Zealand under its influence. 

The war in Europe ends and soon after also on the Pacific, the new world order is brought to life.",history

But even I was shocked by how the Q&A of our Dan Pena movie premiere went down. Dan get's questioned about Global warming and why people like him and Donald Trump simply seem to not care about this issue. Dan responds with his own answer to the question and claims that global warming is a fraud.

Until now only those who attended the exclusive event saw Dan offer to fight anyone in the room‚Ä¶

...brand climate change complete bullshit‚Ä¶

...and predict which countries Trump would soon bomb back to the stone age.

And now our most explosive conversation ever is available in full.

Why you should adopt a Dan Pena attitude to life

It turns out, Iran has a pretty long history of unrest in order to put power in the hands of the people, and the most recent revolution in 1979 was, at least at first, not necessarily about creating an Islamic state. It certainly turned out to be about that, but it was initially just about people who wanted to get rid of an oppressive regime. Listen up as John teaches you about Iran's long history of revolution.

Ajn9g5Gsv98,Slavery - Crash Course US History #13,"In which John Green teaches you about America's ""peculiar institution,"" slavery. I wouldn't really call it peculiar. I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance. Slavery as an institution is arguably the darkest part of America's history, and we're still dealing with its aftermath 150 years after it ended. Support CrashCourse on Patreon:

CcUk4xy-Ai8,History of Jailbreaking,"basically, jailbreaking is a type of ‚Äúprivilege escalation.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a pretty technical term so let me break it down. User privilege refers to how much access a user has to any given system, in this case iOS. And when you jailbreak your iPhone, you gain additional access to parts of the operating system that were previously restricted ‚Äì so you‚Äôre achieving an escalated level of privilege on your device, so privilege escalation. And this is usually achieved by exploiting some kind of design flaw or bug in the operating system. So to sum it up, jailbreaking is a way for users to do a lot more with their iPhone than what was previously possible.

The term ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù originated with iOS, which began pretty much as soon as iPhones were released, but it‚Äôs been used to describe privilege escalation in other systems as well, like Playstation. Similar tools have been developed for other systems in recent years. For example, ‚Äúrooting‚Äù became a popular process among Android phone and tablet users to escalate privileges on those devices. Thanks to a huge community of hackers, developers, and coders that love to tinker with technology, there‚Äôs been a way to jailbreak pretty much every iteration of iOS within a short time of their release.",history

SqDTJogdWmA,A Vanishing History: Gullah Geechee Nation,"On the Sea Islands along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia, a painful chapter of American history is playing out again. These islands are home to the Gullah or Geechee people, the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to work at the plantations that once ran down the southern Atlantic coast. After the Civil War, many former slaves on the Sea Islands bought portions of the land where their descendants have lived and farmed for generations. That property, much of it undeveloped waterfront land, is now some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

But the Gullah are now discovering that land ownership on the Sea Islands isn‚Äôt quite what it seemed. Local landowners are struggling to hold on to their ancestral land as resort developers with deep pockets exploit obscure legal loopholes to force the property into court-mandated auctions. These tactics have successfully fueled a tourism boom that now attracts more than 2 million visitors a year. Gullah communities have all but disappeared, replaced by upscale resorts and opulent gated developments that new locals ‚Äî golfers, tourists, and mostly white retirees ‚Äî  fondly call ‚Äúplantations.‚Äù

Faced with an epic case of d√©j√† vu, the Gullah are scrambling for solutions as their livelihood and culture vanish, one waterfront mansion at a time.

5SnR-e0S6I,Globalization I - The Upside: Crash Course World History #41,"In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.

Also, you should turn on the captions.

1-JAx3nU,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclark

Check out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/

Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics:  

A few nitpicky things:
- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.
- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.
- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.
- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.

I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.

In the 1920s, America's economy was booming, and all kinds of social changes were in progress. Hollywood, flappers, jazz, there was all kinds of stuff going on in the 20s.

In the 14th century a Muslim historian named Ibn Khaldun wrote about the pattern of history. Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire. Conquest, consolidation, expansion, degeneration and conquest, this was the pattern of history.

Take a moment and think about it. Remember it, Share it and maybe, just maybe, we can be great again!

The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who, because of their own apathy, in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!

This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!
Still people don't seem to be getting the point.
I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.
If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.
And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?
Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.

It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.
1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.
2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.
As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",history
lTTvKwCylFY,The French Revolution: Crash Course World History #29,"In which John Green examines the French Revolution, and gets into how and why it differed from the American Revolution. Was it the serial authoritarian regimes? The guillotine? The Reign of Terror? All of this and more contributed to the French Revolution not being quite as revolutionary as it could have been. France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon. But how did all of this change the world, and how did it lead to other, more successful revolutions around the world? Watch this video and find out. Spoiler alert: Marie Antoinette never said, ""Let them eat cake."" Sorry.

1o8oIELbNxE,Luther and the Protestant Reformation: Crash Course World History #218,"In which John Green teaches you about the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the Protestant Reformation, pretty much everyone in Europe was a Roman Catholic. Not to get all great man, but Martin Luther changed all that. Martin Luther didn't like the corruption he saw in the  church, especially the sale of indulgences, so he left the church and started his own. And it caught on! And it really did kind of change the world. The changes increased literacy and education, and some even say the Protestant Reformation was the beginning of Capitalism in Europe.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-her...

2,500 years ago, the writing of history as we know it didn‚Äôt exist. The past was recorded as a list of events, with little explanation for their causes beyond accepting things as the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides to understand the reasons for them. Mark Robinson explains how ‚Äúhistory‚Äù came into being.

In which John Green wraps up revolutions month with what is arguably the most revolutionary of modern revolutions, the Industrial Revolution. While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor.

Meaning the original people groups of Europe that inhabited the landmass before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans, a group which would later evolve into the vast majority of European nations we see today, from the Russians, Italians, Irish, Norwegians and Greeks.

Although precious little is known, there are clues left behind in the archaeology, genetics, linguistics and historical texts that have been passed down through the generations, which gives us a somewhat fuzzy picture of pre-historic Europe. Be sure to let me know your thoughts on the pre-Indo-European Europeans and let me know which culture you think is the most interesting. Thanks for watching!

In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.

Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.

In which John Green teaches you about capitalism and socialism in a way that is sure to please commenters from both sides of the debate. Learn how capitalism arose from the industrial revolution, and then gave rise to socialism. Learn about how we got from the British East India Company to iPhones and consumer culture in just a couple of hundred years. Stops along the way include the rise of industrial capitalism, mass production, disgruntled workers, Karl Marx, and the Socialist Beard. The socialist reactions to the ills of capitalism are covered as well, and John discusses some of the ideas of Karl Marx, and how they've been implemented or ignored in various socialist states. Plus, there are robots!

6E9WU9TGr,"The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards: Crash Course US History #1","In which John Green kicks off Crash Course US History! Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.

******************************************************************************
Today, a good deal is known about different mental illnesses and more is always being learned. Treatments for various mental illnesses are constantly evolving. Throughout history, the mentally ill were not always treated well, and in fact there is evidence that points to inhumane treatment of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses. While many of the treatments throughout history are today considered barbaric, some of them did pave the way for research into more modern and acceptable practices.

-Worst Psychiatric Treatments Throughout History:

1. Lobotomy
2. Trepanning
3. The Utica Crib
4.  Insulin Coma Therapy: Rewiring the Brain
5.Mystic Rituals: Exorcism and Prayer

ZTC_RxWN_x,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]

Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.

In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.

VTc7jSFfRUU,ZDF-History: Promi Geschwister - Verdammt verwandt! Doku (2018),"Sie hei√üen Klitschko, Kennedy, Messner oder Tudor: Was sie eint, ist der Wille zu Macht und Erfolg. Doch w√§hrend die einen Seite an Seite f√ºr ihre Ziele k√§mpfen, stolpern die anderen √ºber Eifers√ºchteleien oder ihre Streitsucht, werden zu erbitterten Feinden.

Dass ein Streit unter Geschwistern sogar lebensgef√§hrlich sein kann, haben die Tudor-Schwestern Elisabeth und Mary eindrucksvoll unter Beweis gestellt. Die katholische und ""blutige Mary"" lie√ü nicht nur jede Menge Protestanten hinrichten, sondern verfolgte auch ihre verhasste Halbschwester Elisabeth, den ""Bastard"" von K√∂nig Heinrich VIII. und Anne Boleyn. Elisabeth landete im Tower und konnte nur mit einem Trick dem Schafott entkommen. Wenige Jahre sp√§ter, nach dem fr√ºhen Tod Marys I. von England, bestieg sie selbst den Thron und regierte England lange und erfolgreich. 

Reinhold Messner hingegen verliert seinen j√ºngeren Bruder durch ein tragisches Ungl√ºck. Von einer gemeinsamen Expedition im Himalaya kommt nur einer der Extrembergsteiger lebend zur√ºck. Die genauen Umst√§nde des Todes von G√ºnther Messner sind bis heute nicht gekl√§rt. 

John F. und Robert, die ber√ºhmtesten Br√ºder des Kennedy-Clans, teilen nicht nur die Leidenschaft f√ºr die Politik, sondern auch ihr tragisches Schicksal: Beide sterben bei einem Mordanschlag. ""ZDF-History"" erz√§hlt die Geschichten von ber√ºhmten Geschwister-Paaren, von denen manche nur den Namen, andere ihr ganzes Leben teilen.",history

This video dives into and fully explores an alternate version of our own human history that connects a lot of dots that up until now, seemed as if random anomalies of the human race. 

The story is certainly different than anything you likely have heard or seen before, but just as well - paints a very complex and yet simple picture of our history, which explains all of the world‚Äôs religions, and the state of the world today. 

All of the struggles that humanity are experiencing, and even why we are struggling to begin with, is explained through this story.

They were called the Anunnaki, which means ‚ÄúThose Who from Heaven to Earth Came‚Äù.  These beings inhabited a distant orbiting planet called Nibiru, which only entered our solar system every 3,600 years.  They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru‚Äôs atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.

During and after the American Revolutionary War, the government of the new country operated under the Articles of Confederation. While these Articles got the young nation through its war with England, they weren't of much use when it came to running a country. So, the founding fathers decided try their hand at nation-building, and they created the Constitution of the United States, which you may remember as the one that says We The People at the top. John will tell you how the convention came together, some of the compromises that had to be made to pass this thing, and why it's very lucky that the framers installed a somewhat reasonable process for making changes to the thing. You'll learn about Shays' Rebellion, the Federalist Papers, the elite vs rabble dynamic of the houses of congress, and start to find out just what an anti-federalist is.

Where is Walden Shyre... and what happened to him on the eve of the Nobel Prize Ceremony?

You've been hired as the new laboratory assistant to the two-time Nobel laureate, Dr. Walden A. Shyre. He's disappeared, and he's left you clues. He has a plan!

In the History of Biology game, you, the assistant, are required to navigate through a labyrinth of clues, objects, and internet sites trying to figure out why Dr. Shyre has disappeared. What secret project was he working on? Who might be after him and are they after you too? Hidden amongst the history of biology, Dr. Shyre has left clues and puzzles to unlock the secrets of his most important and controversial research ever.

History of Biology is an interactive, online science scavenger hunt where students experience the history of biology, through the people and the impact their discoveries had on, and continues to have on, our culture, society, politics, economics, and ethics. Starting in the 17th Century, with the invention of microscopes and the first descriptions of microscopic life, users complete weekly missions and solve puzzles by researching the lives and scientific discoveries of over 20 scientists. Users progress through a rich story-line driven game that parallels the scientific timeline of discovery. The game content takes users through the cell theory, microscopes, classification, evolution, mechanisms of heredity, the central dogma of genetics, the genomics revolution and where biological science is heading in the near future.",history

""Mon couer s'ouvre √† ta voix""  (Camilie Saint-Saens)
Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix,
comme s'ouvrent les fleurs
aux baisers de l'aurore!
Mais, √¥ mon bienaim√©,
pour mieux s√©cher mes pleurs,
que ta voix parle encore!
Dis-moi qu'√† Dalila
tu reviens pour jamais.
Redis √† ma tendresse
les serments d'autrefois,
ces serments que j'aimais!
|: Ah! r√©ponds, r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|

Ainsi qu'on voit des bl√©s
les √©pis onduler
sous la brise l√©g√®re,
ainsi fr√©mit mon coeur,
pr√™t √† se consoler,
√† ta voix qui m'est ch√®re!
La fl√®che est moins rapide
√† porter le tr√©pas,
que ne l'est ton amante
√† voler dans tes bras!
|: Ah! r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|
Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!



""De' Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" (Giuseppe Verdi)
Lunge da lei per me non v'ha diletto!
Volaron gi√† tre lune
Dacch√© la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasci√≤, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ove, agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudii suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella tempr√≤ col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!
Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio io voglio a te fedel,
Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio a te fedel,
Ah s√¨‚Ä¶dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Io vivo in ciel.
Dell'universo immemore.

""Apri la Tua Finestra"" (Pietro Mascagni)
Apri la tua finestra!
Jor son io
Che vengo al tuo chiamar,
Povera Dhia!
Apri la tua finestra
Al raggio mio!
Apri il tuo cor
A mia calda mal√¨a!
Jor ha ascoltata, o Dhia,
La tua preghiera!
Apri l'anima tua,
Fanciulla, al Sole!
Apri l'anima tua alle mie parole!
Apri il tuo cuore a me,
Fanciulla, e spera!

k7ngnWJ6Hk,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. 

Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

P0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

""Never There"" Live acoustic version by Art and Music
Don't waste my time 
Darling I can hear
I‚Äôve always been weird I just needed you there
Just needed you there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years

What makes you cry 
Did playtime pass you by
Always living in fear that you were never there
Well you were never there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years
A time I can‚Äôt recall I‚Äôm told it happened in fall
We headed north up the coast your face turned white as a ghost
The restaurant stopped for a show but momma didn't back down

You‚Äôre gonna hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You'll hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You in the ground
You in the ground
You in the ground

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

Free Press Houston and Work-Order are proud to announce the lineup for Day For Night, an experiential arts and music festival featuring digital artists and renowned musical acts on December 19 and 20 in Houston, TX. Our 2015 lineup represents the culmination of years of development.

Musical artists featured: Kendrick Lamar, New Order, Philip Glass Ensemble, Dillon Francis, Janelle Mon√°e, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Madeon, Nicolas Jaar, Psychic TV, CocoRosie, Elliphant, Battles, Dan Deacon, Com Truise, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore, Holly Herndon, Julien Bayle, Indian Jewelry, U.S. Girls, Jont√© Moaning, Prince Rama, DERU, Matt Thibideau, Roman Gianarthur, Richard Ramirez, Christine Renee, Future Blondes, BOAN, Millennial Grave, Wrestlers, Children of Pop, B L A C K I E, Hearts of Animals, Josiah Gabriel, FLCON FCKER, The Vanity, Light Wheel,Jerk, Bart Black, Prismo, and DJ Fredster. 

This immersive experience showcases leading visual artists who will be employing varying mediums such as light, projection, LED, and sound. The visual lineup includes Casey Reas, Zach Lieberman, School for Poetic Computation, Refik Anadol, Markus Heckmann, Mark Eats, Kamil Nawratil, Nanotak, Gabriel Pulecio, Vincent Houze + AV&C, Masomenos, David Cihelna & Gene Han, Mathew Dryhurst, Alex Czetwertynski, Work-Order, Night Moves, and Neil Ebbflo. 


Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.

Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday, October 8, via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar, complimentary beverages and small plates, access to private lounge, rapid entry, and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. 

Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚Äù

With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",art and music

But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.

Transcript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?

Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",art and music

SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.

This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at  

I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.

I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.

I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about  in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.

Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",art and music

""Art and Music"" by Art and Music
Lets be honest, Kasey Jones of Art and Music is currently not an award winning artist, songwriter or producer. If he had Record Company, Drug Cartel, Big Pharma, Government Military money he probably could be. Why? Because kids, you can buy your way to the top in this game we are all playing. Don't think you are a part of it? Think again and hit the books. So till the scales tip and above becomes below he will be frequently relocated to earth to fulfill his soul contract after numerous other glorious failed attempts.  

He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs using outdated and unreliable equipment in his living room. He's scrappy, hungry, skilled at burning bridges and primed to explode at any moment. Possibly implode. 

Art and Music's highly unanticipated second album ‚ÄúWho are They‚Äù, is a completely independent release. Jones produced, recorded, engineered and performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope. Further demonstrating his sheer insanity.

One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!
He blissfully watches mindless robot sheep perpetuate in consumer stupor, narrowly avoiding mental breakdowns most of the time. Money is a hoax, debt is slavery, media is manipulation, religion is controlled, the system is a lie and Art and Music is awesome!     ",art and music

UAgfy-fILk,Why Artists Don't Make Money - The Business of Life (Episode 3),"This episode of 'The Business of Life' looks at two creative industries going in seemingly opposite trajectories: the fine art world, where the sky is seemingly the limit for the prices collectors are willing to pay; and the music industry, where the free-fall of record company profits has only recently begun to slow.

But at the root of each sector‚Äôs rising or declining fortunes is the underlying question: How should we compensate artists? And what value do cultural products create in a society? To get to the bottom of the issue, we‚Äôve tapped the former New Yorker pop critic Sasha Frere-Jones, award-winning artist Ryder Ripps, and Glenn O‚ÄôBrien, the founder of TV Party, original editor of Interview Magazine, and a former member of Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory.

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:

1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)

2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.

3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.

SO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. 

I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",art and music

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",art and music

Yhif28t47qk,"Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats)","Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats) 

MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...

Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. 

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 

0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 
5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 
10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; 
etc. etc.  up to one hour. 

This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. 

In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. 


As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones.

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

5TuwrYc8EDQ,"Conceptual Art, Writing, and Music with Gage McWeeny and David Lang","Conceptualism not only exists in the visual arts, but also in literature and music. Williams College Professor Gage McWeeny (Ph.D., English and American Literature, Princeton University) has devoted part of his career to the study of twentieth century and contemporary, experimental, or conceptual writing and art. Using Sol LeWitt's wall drawings as a connection to conceptualism in literature, McWeeny sheds light on the writings of Andy Warhol, Kenneth Goldsmith, and others.

David Lang, Pulitzer Prize winning composer for the ""Little Match Girl Passion"" (2008) and co-founder of the musical group Bang on a Can, will also make similar connections between Sol LeWitt's art and his own conceptualist and modernist compositions, as well as the conceptual music of Steve Reich and Tom Johnson.

   http://moyaokruga.ru/niva/Articles.as...

The competition was attended by pupils of the Children's Art School, who were prepared for it's performance by conductors teachers of this institution of additional education. The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers. For the first time, the jury presented the artworks of children studying at the art department of the School of Arts, also included musical and choreographic compositions, puppet shows.

The jury, which included: a methodologist of the department for coordinating the activities of educational organizations in the region of the Saratov regional educational and methodological center N.Ye. Mikhailova, lecturer of the cyclic commission ""Choral Conducting"" of the Saratov Regional College of Arts by name O.V. Oschepkova, a teacher of the highest category of the Central Children's Music School in Saratov, Ye.G. Alferova, teacher of the highest category of the Children's Art School.by name V.V. Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov.
 I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.

And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. 
Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too.
 Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.
The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.

The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.

Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!

You called him on the phone
When you‚Äôre all alone
I know what you do when you do it and where you did it, too

I hope he‚Äôs there for you
I know you always knew
A heart like this doesn‚Äôt come around everyday

And I just can‚Äôt get this out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

So now you know
We‚Äôre bought and sold
It never really mattered that much to me
I was just awake

And I just can‚Äôt get this out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

But my eyes now see through
What I need to do
I‚Äôd like to leave it all in the past and I swear that I‚Äôll never look back

And I just can‚Äôt get you out of my head
Cuz to me you were already dead

N0u04EqNVj,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

Leon Botstein, Conductor / President of Bard College

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

WJaR7rJqKIk,"Art and Incarceration: Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski‚Äôs minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen‚Äôs Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.

About the presenters:
Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of ‚Äúsocially conscious‚Äù compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors ‚Äì including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill ‚Äì and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.

Kasey Jones of Art and Music performing ""Million Miles Away"" on ukulele at the UnUrban Cafe in Santa Monica, CA.
Staring straight down at the sink
I don‚Äôt even need to think
I‚Äôll pass the time with my dog Pitch 
Reminisce about a life we lived

Cuz I can fly a million miles away
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written on my face and it‚Äôs in the line

Sudden thoughts are such a shame 
Left alone they‚Äôll just turn to gray 
A chance that you might never take 
Sinks your soul and it stamps a date

Maybe you can reach me now and again 
But I don‚Äôt think that time is a friend 
AnymoreAnymore

It‚Äôs time I get a P.O. Box 
Collect the mail that I never got 
Buy a ship and sail far away 
to the life that got away

Cuz I can fly a million miles away 
I‚Äôd still be at the same old place
I don‚Äôt need a clock to pass the time 
It‚Äôs written in my face and it‚Äôs in the lie

HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.

In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.

Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.

Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.

On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.

She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚Äù

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance: The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

As we all know that these Lok Baithaks were multifaceted and used to serve the multiple purposes of associationalism, camaraderie, entertainment, social cohesion, knowledge sharing, creation of disciplinarian and organizational spirit, and above all as hub of promotion of art and culture in these communities. This program is open to the people of all age groups and multiple ethnicities in the style that they themselves are the speakers and listeners with the Lok Virsa as regulator and facilitator only.

Participants are encouraged and allowed to bring their musical instruments and artifacts they specialize in. They are motivated to share the values, knowledge, wisdom, stories, songs, tales, fables, epics, jokes, traditional games, riddles etc. overall everything falling within the domain of folklore of their respective regions. Amateur singers and musicians among them sing and play music. 

In this session we would explore the folklore of Kalash valley. Mr. Luke Rehmat and Mr. Geo Bangali Kalash would talk about, and represent their community, on the occasion. As an activist, Luke Rehmat would share the characteristic features of the birth to death rituals, festivals, folk cuisine, and folk festivals of the  people.

xhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,"There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756‚Äì1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical era. Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".

XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.

This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.

Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.

Angie Durbin is a New York based artist whose work is very calligraphic and rhythmic, inspired equally by the energy of people, letterforms and music. The compositions are never planned and are executed spontaneously using instincts and subconscious emotions. Her unique style is packed with symbolism and movements that give each viewer their own experience in each piece.

qBERpxQ5wwA,Ronnie Wood: Art and Music exhibition opens,"On March 28th, Ronnie Wood: Art and Music opens at the William Benton Museum of Art at the University of Connecticut.  This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. 

Created from an insider's perspective, Ronnie portrays his colleagues, his friends, and band-mates, both in group portraits and individually, with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena. Ronnie Wood is one of those rare artists who can express himself through both music and the visual arts, eloquently and expertly.",art and music

-toMaehfmQ,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,"When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.

Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.
New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.

Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.

Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.

New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.

 Special Head Levitation
He is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!

""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton
""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. 

The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.

The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

lyrics:
Lyrics: Caravanserai


A gentle breeze or lightning..This glancing life is like a morning star..
A setting sun, or rolling waves at sea in a storm..
A dancing dream of all eternity..

The sand was shimmering in the morning light
And dancing off the dunes so far away..
The night held music so sweet, so long
And there we lay until the break of day..

We woke that morning at the onward call
Our camels bridled up, our howdahs full
The sun was rising in the eastern sky..
Just as we set out to the desert's cry

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you..

The tents grew smaller as we rode away..
On earth that tells of many passing days..
The months of peace and all the years of war
The lives of love and all the lives of fears..

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

We crossed the river beds all etched in stone
And up the mighty mountains ever known
Beyond the valleys in the searing heat
Until we reached the caravanserai...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you
Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you...

What is this life that pulls me far away..
What is that home where we cannot reside..
What is that quest that pulls me onward
My heart is full when you are by my side...

Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you....",art and music

1IEHGSLwNmQ,"Yoga of Bass - Workshops on Music, Dance, Art and Spirituality with FreQ Nasty and Claire Thompson","The Yoga of Bass is an ongoing discussion and series of workshops by DJ FreQ Nasty (Darin McFadyen) and Claire Thompson on the intersection of Music, Arts and Spirituality.

Yo-ga [Yoh-guh] ‚Äì a practice or discipline.

Bass [Beys] ‚Äì pertaining to the deepest part of music

Examples include:
anything from a discussion of the Ecstasy of Music, given in a nightclub before we rave out, to a workshop comparing the artistic and creative paths, to a weekend of in-depth teachings on the Yoga Sutras or Buddhist Meditation.

The Yoga of Bass talk specifically, which Darin and Claire have offered in the United States, Canada, England and Australia at yoga studios, art spaces, dance clubs, and festivals including Wanderlust Yoga Festival, Lightning in a Bottle, Symbiosis, and Glade, looks at the parallels between the ecstatic, life-changing experiences people have on the dance floor with music, and the peak states of meditation as experienced on the path of Yoga.

Using personal and musical examples from their lives as DJ, singer, meditation teachers and Yogis alongside explanations from the foundational texts of Yoga and Buddhism, Darin and Claire explore how a yogic and spiritual practice can help you bring this feeling of ecstacy, unity and inter-connectedness off the dance floor and into your life.

Darin McFadyen is music producer and international touring DJ FreQ Nasty. He has remixed and/or collaborated with artists as diverse as Kelis, Santigold, Fatboy Slim, Bassnectar, KRS One, avant classical composer Steve Reich and reggae legend Jnr Delgado. He has been practicing Yoga for 13 years and has studied the great texts of Yoga and Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut (www.lamamarut.org). He has also completed a 200-Hour Classics of Yoga Philosophy course with the Yoga Studies Institute (www.yogastudiesinstitute.org) and the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism offered by Asian Classics Institute, Los Angeles. Hear his music at: www.FreQNasty.com.

Claire Thompson has been practicing yoga for 7 years and massage therapy for 13 years. She has received the 200-hour Classics of Yoga training through the Yoga Studies Institute, and has completed the 18 Foundational and 18 Advanced courses in Tibetan Buddhism with Venerable Sumati Marut and the Asian Classics Institute (www.acidharma.org).

dSMiYzBEPY8,Psychosocial programs like art therapy and music therapy help heal kids faster,"Childhood cancer is a family disease in that it affects the life of patients and their parents and siblings. Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. 

Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.

Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.

ZM80F_J-QHE,Bj”ßrk - Mutual Core - OFFICIAL - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"In ""Mutual Core,"" recorded by Bj√∂rk for her seventh album Biophilia, the earth's geology is a metaphor for human relationships. Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Bj√∂rk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

Now that the time has come...
Soon gone is the day
There upon some distant shore
You'll hear me say....

Long as the day in the summer time
Deep as the wine dark sea
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me....

There like a bird I'd fly
High through the air
Reaching for the sun's full rays...
Only to find you there...

And in the night when our dreams are still...
Or when the wind flows free
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me...

Now that the time has come
Soon gone is the day
There upon some distant shore
You'll hear me say....

Long as the day in the summer time
Deep as the wine dark sea
I'll keep your heart with mine...
Till you come to me...",art and music

TONY BENNETT & R. SULLIVAN    Book Number: 74801    Product format: Hardback

With a career that spans 60 years and a fan base that spans all ages, Tony Bennett recently turned 80, and marked the milestone with a year-long creative outburst that included a chart-topping CD of duets with a diverse array of fellow superstar performers, from Streisand and Bono to Stevie Wonder and the Dixie Chicks. He starred in a sensational NBC TV special and performed in one sold-out show after another around the world. As if this were not enough, the UN named him 2007's Humanitarian Award honoree and the Smithsonian selected one of his paintings for their permanent collection. This lovely volume is a glorious celebration of Bennett's lifelong dedication to his passion for painting and singing. In a warm and revealing narrative, he and Robert Sullivan discuss the significant events of his life and career, his personal philosophy and the influences that continue to infuse his creative ability. He reflects on times he has shared with, and lessons he has learned from, the likes of Frank Sinatra, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, David Hockney and many, many more. Readers are whisked from his childhood, living above the grocery store where his father worked, to the magnificent apartment from where he now looks out over Central Park. Along the way he affords us a glimpse of his inner life. The book is richly illustrated with more than 200 reproductions - most of them previously unpublished - of his beautiful artwork, as well as a number of rare items from his collection. An endlessly entertaining 212 pages 29.5cm x 27cm very lavishly illustrated in colour and b/w with detailed appendix including a discography, art biography and an awards and honours listing as well as a FREE MUSIC CD of six tracks all performed by Tony Bennett.

UPk56BR1Cmk,Why art is important | Katerina Gregos | TEDxGhent,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Katerina Gregos is convinced that contemporary art has an important role to play in society, as one of the last frontiers of free expression. Today, artists and cultural practitioners, rather than politicians, are leading some of the key discussions about the state of the world. Contemporary artists challenge each and every one of us to reinterpret social and political events, and crack cemented opinions as well as dominant narratives propagated by the media and those in power. As an internationally respected curator, Katerina has curated a number of exhibitions dedicated to exploring the relationship between art, politics, democracy, the new global production circuits, and human rights. Let yourself be inspired by Katerina‚Äôs talk at TEDxGhent 2014, and find out what contemporary art can contribute to society.

Independent curator and exhibitions organiser

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

Z11No_5QgEQ,"THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE - Art Nouveau (5 of 5) Edward Saunders","THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE (Lecture 5 of 5)

Edward Saunders, freelance lecturer

LECTURE TITLES

1.  The city emerges
2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia
3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk
4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance
5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art Nouveau

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.

The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.

P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,"How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.

In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.

Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. 

This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:

Drawing
Painting
Sculpture
Writing 
Video Creation
Animation
Design

Justin Davis is a multi-talented performing artist who specializes in music, dance, and poetry. In 2011 Davis became cofounder and president of SPOKEN, a Rhode Island College student club for spoken-word poets and other artists. He also performs original songs and covers before live audiences throughout the State of Rhode Island and teaches dance throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A youth development major with minors in dance and jazz studies, Davis hopes to integrate literacy with the arts. He envisions a program where theater students learn to write scripts, spoken-word poets learn to write poetry, musicians learn to write lyrics and choreographers learn to write about their concepts.

Of a world so far it seems,
Can be only found in dreams.

CHORUS:
Come away, O human child,
To the beauties of the wild,
Where your sorrows melt away,
For the worlds more full of weeping,
Than ye can understand.

As the waves of moonlight beckon,
For you to join me there.
As the soft, white jasmine petals,
Drift through the snowy air,
As the sounds of silence cease,
The melody of rest brings peace,
As the purring lions dance,
In the winter-tide brilliance,
As the sky above us glows.
And no more our troubles find us,
In this land that's free of woes.

CHORUS

Where the wandering waters fountain,
In the pools across the dale,
You can eye the reindeer prancing,
To their long forgotten tales.
As they leap and jump and bound,
Our hearts beat to the sound,
Under frosted, ivory sky,
With their sparkling antlers high,
Their hoof-beats serenade,
As we ride across the glade,
Through the silvery, silken snow,
In a wintry wonderland,
With the brisk wind at our backs.
Let me take you there...

CHORUS

As you close your eyes in slumber,
May you take me by the hand.
Let us go where joy and laughter,
Ne'r cease in that fair land.",art and music

April 25, 2019
Speaker: Parissa

Parissa, the grande dame of classical Persian music, led a discussion/workshop on the history, context, and purpose of Iranian classical music.

Parissa is known for her extraordinary vocal ability and style. She is the most prominent and influential Iranian female classical singer of the past fifty years. Parissa studied the repertoire of radif and old tasnifs with Mahmoud Karimi and Abdollah Davami, two of the most celebrated masters of Persian vocal music. She worked for Iran's National Radio and Television Broadcasting and the Ministry of Culture for several years. After the 1979 revolution, she was no longer allowed to perform in public in Iran. Over the past 40 years, her international profile has expanded with performances at festivals and concerts around the world, as well as teaching in academic institutions.

Z11No_5QgEQ,"THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE - Art Nouveau (5 of 5) Edward Saunders","THE ART, ARCHITECTURE AND MUSIC OF PRAGUE (Lecture 5 of 5)

Edward Saunders, freelance lecturer

LECTURE TITLES

1.  The city emerges
2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia
3.  Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk
4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance
5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art Nouveau

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.

The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.



DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers. These recordings are unedited.

Just before he is betrayed by Judas and arrested to be crucified, Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. He struggles with the trial and suffering he knows he will soon face. Jesus' Agony In The Garden reassures you that you are not alone in your suffering.

Mark -36
""And he said to them, ‚ÄòMy soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.‚Äô And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, ‚ÄòAbba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.'""

Luke -45

Just before he is betrayed by Judas and arrested to be crucified, Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. He struggles with the trial and suffering he knows he will soon face. Jesus' Agony In The Garden reassures you that you are not alone in your suffering.

Mark -36
""And he said to them, ‚ÄòMy soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.‚Äô And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, ‚ÄòAbba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.'""

Luke -45
""In His anguish He prayed with all the greater intensity, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. Then He rose from prayer and came to His disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted with grief.""

Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'. She strongly believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. Dr. Ramya Mohan is a psychiatrist, artist, analyst, musician and an educator who is bridging the gap between neuroscience, mental health and creative arts to support brains better. Trained and qualified at both India and the UK, Dr. Mohan specializes in Child and Adult Psychiatry. An Autism champion for the South Surrey Autism board, Dr Mohan is passionate about bringing art and music together with the mind. In 2015, Dr Mohan founded iMANAS London, an organisation which aims to promote the integration of medicine, arts and neuroscience. A highly skilled artist and musician, Dr. Mohan travels the world as an invited guest speaker to discuss her work; her artworks have been displayed in exhibitions in both the UK and India. A formally trained Carnatic and Hindustani singer, Dr. Mohan believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness.

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto
You're looking to score
When they all say hello
You try to ignore them
Cause you want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
Cause you want more

Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things, that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto
You're looking to score
When they all say hello
You try to ignore them
Cause you want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
So you stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure

4oU6RslFU_E,Cosey Fanni Tutti talks Art Sex Music and the writing of her autobiography,"Artist and Throbbing Gristle electronic music pioneer Cosey Fanni Tutti talked to filmmaker Gavin Toomey while she was writing her autobiography 'Art Sex Music'.

Buy the book: 
AMAZON: 
FABER: 

Art Sex Music is the autobiography of a musician who, as a founding member of the avant-garde group Throbbing Gristle and electronic pioneers Chris & Cosey, has consistently challenged the boundaries of music over the past four decades.

It is the account of an artist who, as part of COUM Transmissions, represented Britain at the IXth Biennale de Paris, whose Prostitution show at the ICA in 1976 caused the Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn to declare her, COUM and Throbbing Gristle ‚ÄòWreckers of Civilisation‚Äô, and whose work continues to be held at the vanguard of contemporary art.

And it is the story of her work as a pornographic model and striptease artist which challenged assumptions about morality, erotica and art.",art and music

(Information and introduction of the composers)


Nicholas Fitzgerald:

""I'm Nick Fitzgerald, currently living in Los Angeles, and have been making music for 14 years. I have a B.S. in Music Technology, and got my start in the professional world as a sound designer for video games in 2007. Since, I've moved on to sound editing, music editing, and composing for multimedia. I've always had a passion for Sci-Fi and the creativity involved opens doors for composers to be as as imaginative as the material. Hopefully we can come up with something fulfilling to us all that achieves the vision that Star Citizen has.
Some of my work can be found here:  ""


Fernando Pepe:

""My name is Fernando Pepe from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm 22 and I started to composing last year but I play guitar/piano since 12 years old.
I work with game development (indie game) on soundtracks, sound design, etc.. I took responsibility for it and I'm improving my knowledge since I really like the matter.
Find more about my work here: 


Caden L Welborn:

I'm a twenty one year old musician, composer, and orchestrator. I've been playing the piano since I was two and creating music since I was four. Over the years I've made music of all different genres of music, from piano, electronic, orchestral, to everything in between. I've also released four albums of various genres over the years with my most recent one being the electronic album Retr0grade.
I created this group to do something that has never been done before. The creation of a professional quality unofficial/fan made soundtrack for a game that is still being worked on. I believe we soundly accomplished this goal.

And here: 


Yuchen Tian:

""My name is Yuchen Tian. I currently live in Richmond, Virginia. I have been playing guitar since 14, with genres ranging from indie rock to metal. I make electronic dance music such as trance and eurodance. I also from time to time write other kinds of music as you can hear on my SoundCloud page. I don't have any formal musical education, but I have a great feeling for music, and that helps greatly on writing music.
I've always been a lover of space and space sims. Star Citizen is a long awaited dream. It is my pleasure to work on such projects with other talented people.
Most of my songs are located at  I welcome any comments and criticism.""

jIahPoU,The Resurrection of Jesus Christ - Rosary Meditation Aid - Art and Music,"An aid for mediation while praying the Rosary. The first Glorious Mystery is The Resurrection of Jesus Christ. After His death on the cross, Jesus' body was laid in the tomb. On the third day, they found the stone was rolled away and the tomb was empty. 

Mark 16:6
You need not be amazed! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, the one who was crucified. He has been raised up; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.

1 Corinthians , 17-20, 55
if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.  If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.
But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead
‚ÄúDeath is swallowed up in victory.‚Äù
‚ÄúO death, where is thy victory?
O death, where is thy sting?‚Äù

He is Risen! Hallelujah!

RheSKxNyOL8,"Burning Man 2017: 70,000-strong expected to attend desert art and music festival - TomoNews","BLACK ROCK DESERT, NEVADA ‚Äî The Burning Man festival is here once again as hipsters from across the country start to litter the deserts of Nevada to play in the sand and use some dust. 

The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. 

Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. 

Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. 

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? 
The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. 

It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. 

Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching ‚Äî especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.

lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /Ààp…ëÀêli…ô/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.

Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".

I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Have a wonderful day or evening!

We love abstract art as it is the perfect choice to decorate your home especially if you prefer a modern or minimalistic home design. Abstract art is a way to express your feeling without any special skills as you do not need to follow and guidelines. You can choose any color or form as there is no limitations just pure freedom. Moreover, you can use different unexpected tools to express your creativity. One of the easiest and popular kinds of art if fluid art. It takes only a few steps to create a masterpiece. Besides, it‚Äôs a really cool way to paint as you even don‚Äôt need brushes instead you can use a hairdryer, a mop and a piece of cardboard. So, you don‚Äôt need to have special art skills, take a canvas and acrylic paints and start creating a masterpiece. The main idea of fluid art is the process of pouring paints onto a canvas and spreading paint without a brush. The first step is to take a plastic cup and pour layers of different paint colors in it. Place canvas on top of your cup and carefully flip the whole thing over. Use a hair dryer to spread the paint over the canvas. Now you have a cool decoration item!
If you love impressionism, you can try to paint a picture using‚Ä¶a mop! Yes, it sounds crazy, but watch our tutorial and you will be surprised by the method. 
You can create a cool bleach pen. Could be used to make cute greeting cards and pictures. Take a bowl and pour bleach into it. Remove the core out of the highlighter and soak it until the original color is gone. It will take a couple of hours. After that make a colorful background, take a bleach marker and start creating.

I am a composer from Norway and I started this channel with a simple vision: to create a place that you can visit in order to chill out & relax. I compose music that can be labeled as for example: sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, beautiful music and relaxing music. I love to compose music and I put a lot of work into it. 

Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Have a wonderful day or evening!

~Peder B. Helland

The Anitta from ""Banana"":
This Anitta loves a good joke. Everything is taken with sarcasm and light heart. She always finds a way to make the situation fun. She likes to keep her choices and lifestyle protected under her sense of humor and double entendre, always keeping the people guessing. Sensuality, a good mood, and the ability to laugh at herself. Her style is random and colorful.

Lyric:
You got that chocolate
That yum yum come gimmie some
Cotton candy sweet as gold
Is soft like a sugar plum
Rollup that tootsie
That hershey that bubble gum
I got a sweet tooth for Love

HzzmqUoQ,Why we really really really like repetition in music,"It slays all day.

In episode #5 of Vox Pop's Earworm, producer Estelle Caswell, comes to appreciate the art of repetition with the help of Colin Morris and Elizabeth Margulis. Colin is a computer scientist who created two really amazing ways to visualize repetition in song lyrics and how they've increased over the last 50 or so years. Elizabeth Margulis has dedicated her career to music research and runs the music cognition lab at the University of Arkansas. Her book ""On Repeat: How music plays the mind"" delves deep into the science behind musical repetition and explores the many ways our brains react to it.

The Anitta from ""Banana"":
This Anitta loves a good joke. Everything is taken with sarcasm and light heart. She always finds a way to make the situation fun. She likes to keep her choices and lifestyle protected under her sense of humor and double entendre, always keeping the people guessing. Sensuality, a good mood, and the ability to laugh at herself. Her style is random and colorful.

Lyric:
You got that chocolate
That yum yum come gimmie some
Cotton candy sweet as gold
Is soft like a sugar plum
Rollup that tootsie

""Music has a way of carrying these Divine Vibrations, but music has to be Divine also.The music which is erotic or something very base or related to something very ugly doesn't work out. But if it is a proper music of a proper type then it communicates. But that discretion only comes after realization. What you enjoy there is the vibrations. You feel the cool vibrations and you start enjoying it...The cool vibrations soothe you down."" (Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi)

""The Awakening of the Kundalini in Sahaja Yoga takes place with the touch of Musical Notes. The notes touch the Chakras and the Kundalini gets awakened. The Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara through the Sushumna (Central Path) and through the Chakras. The the Kundalini becomes one with God. Vibrations begin to flow, Yogis go into NIRANANDA (Joyful Meditation) and the seeker begins his journey on the path of evolution."" (Dr. Arun Apte)

x3FpFCef4A8,Fine Art v's Photography what's your thoughts?,"Fine Art v's Photography?  In this video, I discuss a heavily manipulated picture I took last week. Art or Photograph? maybe it's neither?

Last week I was shooting at various locations around Anglesey in Wales. I visited a location I was quite excited to shoot, the Boat wrecks at Dulas Bay. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I wasn't over armored by the positioning of the boat relative to the background. I didn't want to take the same old shots that everyone else takes so I had an idea. What about a composite? 

I shot the actual sky and horizon which was located off to the left of the wreck and simply combined it with the original picture of the boat. Whilst neither image was great after a few tweaks in post-production the end result looked really good.

Art v's Photography - This is my question for you... Is this art or is it Cheating? Surely it's ok if I'm honest with the viewer, isn't it? Maybe I shouldn't have to worry about what other people think? 

For the record, I uploaded the boat picture to my Instagram account and it gained 755 ""likes"" in 12 hours. It's currently at over 900 ""likes"" and it hasn't been live for a day yet. Surely if the Instagram people like it that's good enough? 

Discussing Art v's Photography is always a great debate so please share your thoughts in the comments. I bet some of you don't hold back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Enjoy the video

kOIVaJgv5zE,Billie Eilish - A Snippet into Billie's Mind (Artist Spotlight Stories),"A Snippet into Billie‚Äôs Mind is an audiovisual journey into the thoughts of Billie Eilish, exploring the inspiration behind songs from WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? Produced in collaboration with YouTube Music, this installment of Artist Spotlight Stories acts as the final chapter of our journey inside Billie's head, and unveils the deeply personal, unexpected and infinitely visual creative process of this generation-defining artist. Whether she‚Äôs watching music videos with the sound off, drawing camera angles in her sketchbook, or ascribing a color, shape and texture to each of her songs, Billie breaks down her unique visual language and gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of her mind.",art and music

Lyrics:

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade - it mightbe too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

-Lyrics written 100% by yours truly - 

I'm kinda mad, sad, shaking in, back forth
These hacksaw, slack jaws, kicking in back doors
Its awful, stupid chickens pecking debacles
With mouthfuls freakin chickens, pissing me off URG

I‚Äôm lookin at these people who hating, discrete and evil 
Telling me that I‚Äôm never gunna be anything, a cheap voice
And I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs goin on anymore
Cuz these people lookin at me like I‚Äôm stupid‚Ä¶. Irregulore 

Halt! Putting their words in a vault! 

Lurkin and jerkin to tear what I‚Äôm workin on thinkin it‚Äôs getting them off
Spitting and scoff
Pick on my dreams 
Thinking I'm joke and missing the ball
But what do they mean
its going its going it going it‚Äôs gone

Ha look at me 
I will do and will succeed
If I don't, I don't care
I‚Äôll pull down your underwear

Ha look at me 
I will do and will succeed
If I don't, I don't care
I‚Äôll pull down your underwear

Welp, now I‚Äôm looking up!...
And down at the same time cuz i do not give a WHAT!
Now these people looking at me like i am freaking nuts
Cuz Ill be preaching what we be seeking, never giving up
I'm taking the crash course of beating a dead horse trying to convince (or tell) dorks
That I'ma pass that I'ma hash back glad proving them wrong cuz
I‚Äôll be silly with it back down to my booshwa
Call me Liza Koshy
Mad puns
Booha

Ha look at me 
I will do and will succeed
If I don't, I don't care
I‚Äôll pull down your underwear

And now I sit down reflect and backtrack
To those wack from my past who passed trash
Who act bad who say that I'm‚Ä¶ nothing.. a cast out
Get back in your glass house cuz not only am I something‚Ä¶ I'm SomeThingElse

Ha look at me 
I will do and will succeed
If I don't, I don't care
I‚Äôll pull down your underwear
Ha look at me 
I will do and will succeed
If I don't, I don't care

Lyrics

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you""",art and music
