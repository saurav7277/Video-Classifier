## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in making a video classifier that is able to classify video  into 6 different categories.The motivation came from world's most popular entertainment service provider "Netflix","Hotstar" etc. which uses this concept to classify all the videos present on their platform in order to provide ease in finding a particular video.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 files here:


1-Video-Classifier.ipynb :-It is the jupyter notebook file where the project is implemented.It contains all the coding and documentations.

2-Video-Classifie.html :- It is the html version of the above file

3-df_merged.csv :-It is the dataset that has been created as a part of the project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The classifier can classify any videos into 6 different categories namely:

1-Travel

2-Science and Technology

3-Food

4-Manufacturing

5-History
